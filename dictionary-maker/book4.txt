the coastal areas in particular are surprisingly

2017-18Equally important is the fact that the science of
cartography differed in the two periods. When historians
read documents, maps and texts from the past they
have to be sensitive to the different historical
backgrounds – the contexts – in which information
about the past was produced.
New and Old Terminologies
If the context in which information is produced
changes with time, what about language and
meanings? Historical records exist in a variety of
languages which have changed considerably over the
years. Medieval Persian, for example, is different from
modern Persian. The difference is not just with regard
to grammar and vocabulary; the meanings of words
also change over time.
Take the term “Hindustan”, for example. Today we
understand it as “India”, the modern nation-state.
When the term was used in the thirteenth century by
Minhaj-i-Siraj, a chronicler who wrote in Persian, he
meant the areas of Punjab, Haryana and the lands
between the Ganga and Yamuna. He used the term in
a political sense for lands that were a part of the
dominions of the Delhi Sultan. The areas included in
this term shifted with the extent of the Sultanate but
the term never included south India. By contrast, in
the early sixteenth century Babur used Hindustan to
describe the geography, the fauna and the culture of
the inhabitants of the subcontinent. As we will see later
in the chapter, this was somewhat similar to the way
the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used the
word “Hind”. While the idea of a geographical and
cultural entity like “India” did exist, the term
“Hindustan” did not carry the political and national
meanings which we associate with it today.
?
Can you think of
any other words
whose meanings
change in different
contexts?
Historians today have to be careful about the terms
they use because they meant different things in the past.
Take, for example, a simple term like “foreigner”. It is
used today to mean someone who is not an Indian. In
3
TRACING CHANGES ...
2017-18the medieval period a “foreigner” was any stranger who
appeared say in a given village, someone who was not
a part of that society or culture. (In Hindi the term
pardesi might be used to describe such a person and
in Persian, ajnabi.) A city-dweller, therefore, might have
regarded a forest-dweller as a “foreigner”, but two
peasants living in the same village were not foreigners
to each other, even though they may have had different
religious or caste backgrounds.
Historians and their Sources
Historians use different types of sources to learn about
the past depending upon the period of their study and
the nature of their investigation. Last year, for example,
you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty and
Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about the
following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750.
You will notice some continuity in the sources used
by historians for the study of this period. They still rely
on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual records
for information. But there is also considerable
discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records
increased dramatically during this period. They slowly
displaced other types of available information. Through
this period paper gradually became cheaper and more
The value of paper
Compare the following:
(1) In the middle of the thirteenth century a scholar
wanted to copy a book. But he did not have enough
paper. So he washed the writing off a manuscript he did
not want, dried the paper and used it.
(2) A century later, if you bought some food in the
market you could be lucky and have the shopkeeper
wrap it for you in some paper.

2017-18widely available. People used it to write holy texts,
chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints,
petitions and judicial records, and for registers of
accounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by
wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They
were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts
and documents provide a lot of detailed information to
historians but they are also difficult to use.
There was no printing press in those days so scribes
copied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a
friend’s homework you would know that this is not a
simple exercise. Sometimes you cannot read your
friend’s handwriting and are forced to guess what is
written. As a result there are small but significant
differences in your copy of your friend’s work.
Manuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes
copied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes
– a word here, a sentence there. These small differences
grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the

same text became substantially different from one
another. This is a serious problem because we rarely
find the original manuscript of the author today. We
are totally dependent upon the copies made by later
scribes. As a result historians have to read different
manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the
author had originally written.
On occasion authors revised their chronicles at
different times. The fourteenth-century chronicler
Ziyauddin Barani wrote his chronicle first in 1356 and
another version two years later. The two differ from each
other but historians did not know about the existence
of the first version until the 1960s. It remained lost in
large library collections.
New Social and Political Groups
The study of the thousand years between 700 and 1750
is a huge challenge to historians largely because of the
scale and variety of developments that occurred over
the period. At different moments in this period new
technologies made their appearance – like the Persian

firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived
in the subcontinent – potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and
coffee. Remember that all these innovations – new
technologies and crops – came along with people, who
brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this
was a period of economic, political, social and cultural
changes. You will learn about some of these changes
in Chapters 5, 6 and 7.
This was also a period of great mobility. Groups of
people travelled long distances in search of opportunity.
The subcontinent held immense wealth and the
possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of
people who became important in this period were the
Rajputs, a name derived from “Rajaputra”, the son of a
ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the
term was applied more generally to a group of warriors
who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included

commanders who served in the armies of different
monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of
conduct – extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty –
were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets
and bards. Other groups of people such as the
Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste
of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities
of the age to become politically important.

OUR PASTS
– II
Throughout this period there was a gradual clearing
of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change
faster and more complete in some areas than in others.
Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers
to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became
peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began
to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests,
monasteries and temples. They became part of large,
complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and
offer goods and services to local lords. As a result,
significant economic and social differences emerged
amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive
land, others also kept cattle, and some combined
artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean
season. As society became more differentiated, people
were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on
the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations.
Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according
to the power, influence and resources controlled by
members of the jati. The status of the same jati could
vary from area to area.
Jatis framed their own rules and regulations to
manage the conduct of their members. These regulations
were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in
some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also
required to follow the rules of their villages. Several
villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were
only one small unit of a state.

Language and region
In 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was
a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi,
Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka),
Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma‘bari
(in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) ... Awadhi (in eastern
Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi).
Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these
languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to
any region. It was an old language and “ common people
do not know it, only the Brahmanas do”.
Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir Khusrau.
Prepare another list of the names of languages spoken
today in the regions he mentioned. Underline names that

?
Did you notice that the names by which languages
are known have changed over time?
By 700 many regions already possessed distinct
geographical dimensions and their own language and
cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these
in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific
ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict
between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the
Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to
build an empire that was pan-regional – spanning
diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable
or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in
Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the
Khalji and Mughal dynasties?

2017-18When the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth
century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states
(Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule
had altered the character of the regions. Across most of
the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies
of the big and small states that had ruled over them.
This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct
and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the
management of the economy, elite cultures, and
language. Through the thousand years between 700
and 1750 the character of the different regions did not
grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger
pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite
losing their distinctiveness.

Old and New Religions
The thousand years of history that we are exploring
witnessed major developments in religious traditions.
People’s belief in the divine was sometimes deeply
personal, but more usually it was collective. Collective
belief in a supernatural agency – religion – was often
closely connected with the social and economic
organisation of local communities. As the social worlds
of these groups altered so too did their beliefs.
It was during this period that important changes
occurred in what we call Hinduism today. These
included the worship of new deities, the construction
of temples by royalty and the growing importance of
Brahmanas, the priests, as dominant groups in society.
Their knowledge of Sanskrit texts earned the
Brahmanas a lot of respect in society. Their dominant
position was consolidated by the support of their
patrons – new rulers searching for prestige.
One of the major developments of this period was
the emergence of the idea of bhakti – of a loving,
personal deity that devotees could reach without the
aid of priests or elaborate rituals. You will be learning
about this, and other traditions, in Chapter 8.

TRACING CHANGES ...
2017-18This was also the period when new religions
appeared in the subcontinent. Merchants and
migrants first brought the teachings of the holy Quran
to India in the seventh century. Muslims regard the
Quran as their holy book and accept the sovereignty
of the one God, Allah, whose love, mercy and bounty
embrace all those who believe in Him, without regard
to social background.
Many rulers were patrons of Islam and the ulama –
learned theologians and jurists. And like Hinduism,
Islam was interpreted in a variety of ways by its
followers. There were the Shia Muslims who believed
that the Prophet Muhammad’s son-in-law, Ali, was the
legitimate leader of the Muslim community, and the
Sunni Muslims who accepted the authority of the early
leaders (Khalifas) of the community, and the succeeding
Khalifas. There were other important differences
between the various schools of law (Hanafi and Shafi’i
mainly in India), and in theology and mystic traditions.
Thinking about Time and
Historical Periods
Historians do not see time just as a passing of hours,
days or years – as a clock or a calendar. Time also
reflects changes in social and economic organisation,
in the persistence and transformation of ideas and
beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by
dividing the past into large segments – periods – that
possess shared characteristics.
In the middle of the nineteenth century British
historians divided the history of India into three periods:
“Hindu”, “Muslim” and “British”. This division was
based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the
only important historical change, and that there were
no other significant developments – in the economy,
society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich
diversity of the subcontinent.
OUR PASTS
– II
12
2017-18Few historians follow this periodisation today. Most
look to economic and social factors to characterise the
major elements of different moments of the past. The
histories you read last year included a wide range of
early societies – hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people
living in towns and villages, and early empires and
kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year
are often described as “medieval”. You will find out more
about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional
and imperial state formations – sometimes at the cost
of pastoral and forest people – the development of
Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival
of European trading companies.
These thousand years of Indian history witnessed
considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and
eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth
or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period
as one historical unit is not without its problems.
Moreover, the “medieval” period is often contrasted with
the “modern” period. “Modernity” carries with it a sense
of material progress and intellectual advancement. This
seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking
in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this
was not the case.
During these thousand years the societies of the
subcontinent were transformed often and economies
in several regions reached a level of prosperity that
attracted the interest of European trading companies.
As you read this book, look out for signs of change
and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever
you can, compare what you read in this book with
what you read last year. Look out for changes and
continuities wherever you can, and look at the world

2017-18The Emergence of New Dynasties
By the seventh century there were big landlords or
warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent.
Existing kings often acknowledged them as their
subordinates or samantas. They were
expected to bring gifts for their
kings or overlords, be present at
their courts and provide them with
military support. As samantas gained
power and wealth, they declared
themselves to be maha-samanta,
maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of
a “circle” or region) and so on.
Sometimes they asserted their
independence from their overlords.
One such instance was that of the
Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially
they were subordinate to the Chalukyas
of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century,
Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief,
overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual
called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When
this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it
was thought to lead to the “rebirth” of the sacrificer as a
Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth.
In other cases, men from enterprising families used
their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance,
the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara-
Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up
their traditional professions and took to arms,
successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and
Rajasthan respectively.

such as maharaja-adhiraja (great king, overlord of
kings), tribhuvana-chakravartin (lord of the three
worlds) and so on. However, in spite of such claims,
17
NEW KINGS AND
KINGDOMS
2017-18they often shared power with their samantas as well as
with associations of peasants, traders and Brahmanas.
In each of these states, resources were obtained from
the producers – that is, peasants, cattle-keepers,
artisans – who were often persuaded or compelled to
surrender part of what they produced. Sometimes
these were claimed as “rent” due to a lord who asserted
that he owned the land. Revenue was also collected
from traders.
Four hundred taxes!
The inscriptions of the Cholas who ruled in Tamil Nadu
refer to more than 400 terms for different kinds of taxes.
The most frequently mentioned tax is vetti, taken not in
cash but in the form of forced labour, and kadamai, or
land revenue. There were also taxes on thatching the
house, the use of a ladder to climb palm trees, a cess on
succession to family property, etc.
?
?
In what ways was
this form of
administration
different from the
present-day
system?
Are any such taxes collected today?
These resources were used to finance the king’s
establishment, as well as for the construction of temples
and forts. They were also used to fight wars, which were
in turn expected to lead to the acquisition of wealth in the
form of plunder, and access to land as well as trade routes.
The functionaries for collecting revenue were
generally recruited from influential families, and
positions were often hereditary. This was true about
the army as well. In many cases, close relatives of the
king held these positions.
Prashastis and Land Grants
Prashastis contain details that may not be literally true.
But they tell us how rulers wanted to depict themselves
– as valiant, victorious warriors, for example. These were
composed by learned Brahmanas, who occasionally
helped in the administration.

Many rulers described their achievements in prashastis
(you read about the prashasti of the Gupta ruler
Samudragupta last year).
One prashasti, written in Sanskrit and found in
Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, describes the exploits of
Nagabhata, a Pratihara king, as follows:
The kings of Andhra, Saindhava (Sind), Vidarbha (part of
Maharashtra) and Kalinga (part of Orissa) fell before him even
as he was a prince ...
He won a victory over Chakrayudha (the ruler of Kanauj) ...
He defeated the king of Vanga (part of Bengal), Anarta (part

This is what the land contains: fruit-bearing trees, water,
land, gardens and orchards, trees, wells, open spaces, pasture-
land, a village, anthills, platforms, canals, ditches, rivers,
silt-laden land, tanks, granaries, fish ponds, bee hives, and
deep lakes.
He who receives the land can collect taxes from it. He can
collect the taxes imposed by judicial officers as fines, the tax
on betel-leaves, that on woven cloth, as well as on vehicles.
He can build large rooms, with upper stories made of baked
bricks, he can get large and small wells dug, he can plant
trees and thorny bushes, if necessary, he can get canals
constructed for irrigation. He should ensure that water is not
wasted, and that embankments are built.

poem containing the history of kings who ruled over
Kashmir. It was composed by an author named
Kalhana. He used a variety of sources, including
inscriptions, documents, eyewitness accounts and
earlier histories, to write his account. Unlike the writers
of prashastis, he was often critical about rulers and
their policies.
Warfare for Wealth
You may have noticed that each of these ruling
dynasties was based in a specific region. At the same
time, they tried to control other areas. One particularly
OUR PASTS

20
2017-18prized area was the city of Kanauj in the Ganga valley.
For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-Pratihara,
Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for control over
Kanauj. Because there were three “parties” in this long-
drawn conflict, historians often describe it as the
“tripartite struggle”.
As we will see (pp. 62-66), rulers also tried to
demonstrate their power and resources by building
large temples. So, when they attacked one another’s
kingdoms, they often chose to target temples, which
were sometimes extremely rich. You will read more
about this in Chapter 5.
One of the best known of such rulers is Sultan
Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan. He ruled from 997 to
1030, and extended control over parts of Central Asia,
Iran and the north-western part of the subcontinent.
He raided the subcontinent almost every year – his
targets were wealthy temples, including that of
Somnath, Gujarat. Much of the wealth Mahmud carried
away was used to create a splendid capital city at
Ghazni.
Sultan Mahmud was also interested in finding
out more about the people he conquered, and
entrusted a scholar named Al-Biruni to write an
account of the subcontinent. This Arabic work,
known as the Kitab ul-Hind, remains an important
source for historians. He consulted Sanskrit
scholars to prepare this account.
Other kings who engaged in warfare included the
Chahamanas, later known as the Chauhans, who ruled
over the region around Delhi and Ajmer. They
attempted to expand their control to the west and the
east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas of
Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar
Pradesh. The best-known Chahamana ruler was
Prithviraja III (1168-1192), who defeated an Afghan
ruler named Sultan Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but
lost to him the very next year, in 1192.

From Uraiyur to Thanjavur
How did the Cholas rise to power? A minor chiefly family
known as the Muttaraiyar held power in the Kaveri
delta. They were subordinate to the Pallava kings of
Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, who belonged to the ancient
chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the
delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth
century. He built the town of Thanjavur and a temple
for goddess Nishumbhasudini there.
The successors of Vijayalaya conquered
neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew in size and
power. The Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the
south and north were made part of this kingdom.

these expeditions.
Splendid Temples and Bronze Sculpture
The big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikonda-

architectural and sculptural marvels.
Chola temples often became the nuclei of settlements
which grew around them. These were centres of craft
production. Temples were also endowed with land by

at the temple and very often lived near it – priests,
garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians,
dancers, etc. In other words, temples were not
only places of worship; they were the hub of
economic, social and cultural life as well.
Amongst the crafts associated with temples,
the making of bronze images was the most
distinctive. Chola bronze images are
considered amongst the finest in the world.
While most images were of deities,
sometimes images were made of
devotees as well.
Agriculture and Irrigation
Many of the achievements of the
Cholas were made possible through
new developments in agriculture. Look
at Map 2 again. Notice that the river Kaveri
branches off into several small channels before
emptying into the Bay of Bengal. These
channels overflow frequently, depositing
fertile soil on their banks. Water from the
channels also provides the necessary
moisture for agriculture, particularly the
cultivation of rice.
Although agriculture had developed earlier
in other parts of Tamil Nadu, it was only from
the fifth or sixth century that this area was
opened up for large-scale cultivation. Forests
had to be cleared in some regions; land had
to be levelled in other areas. In the delta region
embankments had to be built to prevent
flooding and canals had to be constructed to

grown in a year.
In many cases it was necessary to water crops
artificially. A variety of methods were used for irrigation.
In some areas wells were dug. In other places huge
tanks were constructed to collect rainwater. Remember
that irrigation works require planning – organising
labour and resources, maintaining these works and
deciding on how water is to be shared. Most of the new
rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an active
interest in these activities.

A sluice gate is
traditionally a wood or
metal barrier which is
commonly used to
control water levels
and flow rates in rivers
and canals.
The Administration of the Empire
How was the administration organised? Settlements
of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous
with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups of
such villages formed larger units called nadu. The
village council and the nadu performed several
administrative functions including dispensing
justice and collecting taxes.
Rich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised
considerable control over the affairs of the nadu under
the supervision of the central Chola government. The
Chola kings gave some rich landowners titles like
muvendavelan (a velan or peasant serving three kings),
araiyar (chief), etc. as markers of respect, and entrusted
them with important offices of the state at the centre.

NEW KINGS AND

2017-18Types of land
Chola inscriptions mention several categories of land:
vellanvagai
land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors
brahmadeya
land gifted to Brahmanas
shalabhoga
land for the maintenance of a school
devadana, tirunamattukkani
land gifted to temples
pallichchhandam
land donated to Jaina institutions
We have seen that Brahmanas often received land
grants or brahmadeya. As a result, a large number of
Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley as
in other parts of south India.
Each brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly
or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders. These
assemblies worked very efficiently. Their decisions were
recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone
walls of temples. Associations of traders known as
nagarams also occasionally performed administrative
functions in towns.
Inscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput
district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in
which the sabha was organised. The sabha had
separate committees to look after irrigation works,
gardens, temples, etc. Names of those eligible to be
members of these committees were written on small
tickets of palm leaf; these tickets were put into an
earthenware pot, from which a young boy was asked
to take out the tickets, one by one for each committee.

They should have their own homes.
They should be between 35 and 70 years of age.
They should have knowledge of the Vedas.
They should be well-versed in administrative matters

While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men,
here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfth-

ordinary men and women.
On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas
(a name used for a social group considered “outcastes” by
Brahmanas and Vellalas), studded with small huts under old
thatches and inhabited by agrarian labourers engaged in
menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered with
strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups; dark
children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing
about, carrying little puppies ... In the shade of the marudu
(arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a
sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches
drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little
hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping.
The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny
Pulaiyar (plural) to their day’s work; and by day, under the

n Chapter 2 we saw that regions like the Kaveri delta
became the centre of large kingdoms. Did you notice
that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi
as its capital? That was because Delhi became an
important city only in the twelfth century.
Take a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital
of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were
defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the
Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer.
It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi
became an important commercial centre. Many rich
Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several
temples. Coins minted here, called
dehliwal, had a wide circulation.

the language of administration under the Delhi Sultans.

The authors of tawarikh were learned men:
secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers, who
both recounted events and advised rulers on
governance, emphasising the importance of just rule.
The circle of justice
?
Fakhr-i Mudabbir wrote in the thirteenth century:
Do you think the
circle of justice is
an appropriate
term to describe
the relationship
between the king
and his subjects?
OUR PASTS
– II
A king cannot survive without soldiers. And soldiers cannot
live without salaries. Salaries come from the revenue collected
from peasants. But peasants can pay revenue only when they
are prosperous and happy. This happens when the king
promotes justice and honest governance.
32
2017-18Keep the following additional details in mind: (1) the
authors of tawarikh lived in cities (mainly Delhi) and
hardly ever in villages. (2) They often wrote their histories
for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards. (3) These authors
advised rulers on the need to preserve an “ideal” social
order based on birthright and gender distinctions.
Their ideas were not shared by everybody.
In 1236 Sultan Iltutmish’s daughter, Raziyya,
became Sultan. The chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i Siraj,
recognised that she was more able and qualified than
all her brothers. But he was not comfortable at having
a queen as ruler. Nor were the nobles happy at her
attempts to rule independently. She was removed from
the throne in 1240.
What Minhaj-i Siraj thought about
Raziyya
Minhaj-i Siraj thought that the queen’s rule went against
the ideal social order created by God, in which women
were supposed to be subordinate to men. He therefore
asked: “In the register of God’s creation, since her account
did not fall under the column of men, how did she gain
from all of her excellent qualities?”
Birthright
Privileges claimed
on account of
birth. For example,
people believed
that nobles
inherited their
rights to govern,
because they
were born in
certain families.
Gender
distinctions
Social and biological
differences between
women and men.
Usually, these
differences are used
to argue that men
are superior to
women.
On her inscriptions and coins Raziyya mentioned
that she was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish. This
was in contrast to the queen Rudramadevi (1262-
1289), of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, part of
modern Andhra Pradesh. Rudramadevi changed her
name on her inscriptions and pretended she was a
man. Another queen, Didda, ruled in Kashmir (980-
1003). Her title is interesting: it comes from “didi” or
“elder sister”, an obviously affectionate term given
to a loved ruler by her subjects.
?
Express Minhaj’s ideas in your own words. Do you
think Raziyya shared these ideas? Why do you think
it was so difficult for a woman to be a ruler?

Hinterland
The lands

In the early thirteenth century the control of the Delhi
Sultans rarely went beyond heavily fortified towns
occupied by garrisons. The Sultans seldom controlled
the hinterland of the cities and were therefore
dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies.
Controlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and
Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult. Rebellion, war,
even bad weather could snap fragile communication
routes. Delhi’s authority was also challenged by Mongol
invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who
rebelled at any sign of the Sultan’s weakness. The
Sultanate barely survived these challenges. Its
consolidation occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin
Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji
and Muhammad Tughluq.
Garrison town
A fortified
settlement, with
soldiers.
The first set of campaigns along the “internal frontier”
of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands
of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests
were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and hunter-
gatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitat.
OUR PASTS

34
2017-18These lands were given to peasants and agriculture was
encouraged. New fortresses, garrison towns and towns
were established to protect trade routes and to promote
regional trade.
The second expansion occurred along the “external
frontier” of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into
southern India started during the reign of Alauddin
Khalji (see Map 3) and culminated with Muhammad
Tughluq. In their campaigns, Sultanate armies
captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away
precious metals.
By the end of Muhammad Tughluq’s reign, 150 years
after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the
Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the
subcontinent. They had defeated rival armies and seized
cities. The Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry
and dispensed justice in its realm. But how complete
and effective was its control over such a vast territory?

A mosque is called a masjid in Arabic, literally a
place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to
Allah. In a “congregational mosque” (masjid-i-jami or
jama masjid) Muslims read their prayers (namaz)
together. Members of the congregation choose the
most respected, learned male as their leader (imam)
for the rituals of prayer. He also delivers the sermon
(khutba) during the Friday prayer.
During prayer, Muslims stand facing Mecca. In
India this is to the west. This is called the qibla.

A Closer Look: Administration and
Consolidation under the Khaljis
and Tughluqs
The consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the
Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and
administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats and
landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans,
especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves
purchased for military service, called bandagan in
Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of
the most important political offices in the kingdom.
Since they were totally dependent upon their master,
the Sultan could trust and rely upon them.
37
THE DELHI SULTANS
2017-18Slaves rather than sons
The Sultans were advised:
A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be
looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to
find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that
a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son ...
?
Can you think of any reason why a slave would be
better than a son?
The Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use
bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who
were often their clients, to high political positions. They
were appointed as generals and governors. However,
this also introduced an element of political instability.
Client
Someone who is
under the
protection of
another; a
dependent or
hanger-on.
Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and
patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their
own servants. As a result the accession of a new
monarch often saw conflict between the old and the
new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by
the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the
authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans
for appointing the “low and base-born” to high offices.
Officials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq
Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar,
a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh,
a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to
high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a mid-
fourteenth-century chronicler, reported their
appointments as a sign of the Sultan’s loss of political
judgement and his incapacity to rule.
?
OUR PASTS
– II
Why do you think Barani criticised the Sultan?
38
2017-18Like the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq
monarchs appointed military commanders as
governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands
were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or
muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military
campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas.
In exchange for their military services, the muqtis
collected the revenues of their assignments as salary.
They also paid their soldiers from these revenues.
Control over muqtis was most effective if their office
was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for
a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh
conditions of service were rigorously imposed during
the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad
Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to
check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis.
Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes
prescribed by the state and that he kept the required
number of soldiers.
As the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the
cities under their control, they forced the landed
chieftains – the samanta aristocrats – and rich
landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin
Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection
of land revenue under its own control. The rights of
the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and
they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan’s
administrators measured the land and kept careful
accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords
served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and
assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on
cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50
per cent of the peasant’s produce, (2) on cattle and
(3) on houses.
It is important to remember that large parts of the
subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi
Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces
like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing
southern India, the entire region became independent.
Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas
39
THE DELHI SULTANS
2017-18that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local
chieftains established their rule in these regions.
Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and
Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these
areas but only for a short duration.
Chieftains and their fortifications
Ibn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco,
Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes
fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged
places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is
not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that
even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very
strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them
as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops.
There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which
collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by
powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the
bamboos with specially prepared instruments.
?
Describe the ways in which the chieftains arranged
for their defence.
The Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded
Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi
Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol
attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the
reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of
Muhammad Tughluq’s rule. This forced the two rulers
to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed
a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the
two Sultans dealt with this.
OUR PASTS
– II
40
2017-18Alauddin Khalji
Muhammad Tughluq
Delhi was attacked twice, in
1299/1300 and 1302-1303.
As a defensive measure,
Alauddin Khalji raised a large
standing army. The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of
Muhammad Tughluq’s reign. The Mongol army was
defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about
the strength of his army and his resources to plan an
attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large
standing army.
Alauddin constructed a new
garrison town named Siri for
his soldiers. See Map 1. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the
oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was
emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned
there. The residents of the old city were sent to the
new capital of Daulatabad in the south.
The soldiers had to be fed. This
was done through the produce
collected as tax from lands
between the Ganga and Yamuna.
Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of
the peasant’s yield. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to
feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining
such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied
additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the
area.
The soldiers had to be paid.
Alauddin chose to pay his
soldiers salaries in cash rather
than iqtas. The soldiers would
buy their supplies from
merchants in Delhi and it was
thus feared that merchants
would raise their prices. To stop
this, Alauddin controlled the
prices of goods in Delhi. Prices
were carefully surveyed by
officers, and merchants who did
not sell at the prescribed rates
were punished. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash
salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a
“token” currency, somewhat like present-day paper
currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and
silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust
these coins. They were very smart: they saved their
gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the
state with this token currency. This cheap currency
could also be counterfeited easily.
Alauddin’s administrative
measures were quite successful
and chroniclers praised his reign
for its cheap prices and efficient
supplies of goods in the market.
He successfully withstood the
threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq’s administrative measures
were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a
disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade
T ransoxiana and disbanded his large ar my.
Meanwhile, his administrative measures created
complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad
was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the
Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And
finally, the “token” currency had to be recalled.
41
THE DELHI SULTANS
2017-18In this list of Muhammad Tughluq’s failures we
sometimes forget that for the first time in the history
of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign
to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin’s
defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq’s measures
were conceived as a part of a military offensive against
the Mongols.
The Sultanate in the Fifteenth and
Sixteenth Centuries
Take a look at Table 1 again. You will notice that after
the Tughluqs, the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties ruled from
Delhi and Agra until 1526. By then, Jaunpur, Bengal,
Malwa, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the entire south India
had independent rulers who established flourishing
states and prosperous capitals. This was also the period
which saw the emergence of new ruling groups like the
Afghans and the Rajputs.
Some of the states established in this period were
small but powerful and extremely well administered.
Sher Shah Sur (1540-1545) started his career as the

2017-18The “Three Orders”, the “Peace of God”,
Knights and the Crusades
The idea of the “Three Orders” was first formulated in France in the
early eleventh century. It divided society into three classes: those
who prayed, those who fought, and those who tilled the land. This
division of society into “Three Orders” was supported by the Church
to consolidate its dominant role in society. This helped the
emergence of a new warrior group called Knights.
The Church patronised this group and used them to propagate
their idea of “Peace of God”. The attempt was to direct warriors
away from conflict amongst themselves and send them instead on
a campaign against the Muslims who had captured the city of
Jerusalem. This led to a series of campaigns called the Crusades.
These campaigns in the service of God and the Church completely
altered the status of Knights. Originally, these Knights did not belong
to the class of nobles. But by the end of the eleventh century in
France, and a century later in Germany, the humble origins of these
warriors were forgotten. By the twelfth century, nobles also wanted
to be known as Knights.

THE MUGHAL EMPIRE
R
uling as large a territory as the Indian subcontinent
with such a diversity of people and cultures was
an extremely difficult task for any ruler to accomplish
in the Middle Ages. Quite in contrast to their
predecessors, the Mughals created an empire and
accomplished what had hitherto seemed possible for
only short periods of time. From the latter half of the
sixteenth century they expanded their kingdom from
Agra and Delhi, until in the seventeenth century they
controlled nearly all of the subcontinent. They imposed
structures of administration and ideas of governance
that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy that
succeeding rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore.
Today the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation
on Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red
Fort in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors.

THE MUGHAL EMPIRE
2017-18Who were the Mughals?
The Mughals were descendants of two great lineages of
rulers. From their mother’s side they were descendants
of Genghis Khan (died 1227), the Mongol ruler who
ruled over parts of China and Central Asia. From their
father’s side they were the successors of Timur (died
1404), the ruler of Iran, Iraq and modern-day Turkey.
However, the Mughals did not like to be called Mughal
or Mongol. This was because Genghis Khan’s memory
was associated with the massacre of innumerable
people. It was also linked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol
competitors. On the other hand, the Mughals were

“group photograph”.
Mughal Military Campaigns
Babur, the first Mughal emperor (1526-
1530), succeeded to the throne of
Ferghana in 1494 when he was only
12 years old. He was forced to leave
his ancestral throne due to the invasion
of another Mongol group, the Uzbegs.
After years of wandering he seized
Kabul in 1504. In 1526 he defeated the
Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi, at
Panipat and captured Delhi and Agra.

campaigns of the Mughals. Study it

Akbar was 13 years old when he became emperor. His
reign can be divided into three periods.
(1) 1556-1570 – Akbar became independent of the regent
Bairam Khan and other members of his domestic staff.
Military campaigns were launched against the Suris and
other Afghans, against the neighbouring kingdoms of
Malwa and Gondwana, and to suppress the revolt of his
half-brother Mirza Hakim and the Uzbegs. In 1568 the
Sisodiya capital of Chittor was seized and in 1569
Ranthambhor.
(2) 1570-1585 – military campaigns in Gujarat were
followed by campaigns in the east in Bihar, Bengal and
Orissa. These campaigns were complicated by the
1579-1580 revolt in support of Mirza Hakim.
(3) 1585-1605 – expansion of Akbar’s empire. Campaigns
were launched in the north-west. Qandahar was seized
from the Safavids, Kashmir was annexed, as also Kabul,
after the death of Mirza Hakim. Campaigns in the Deccan
started and Berar, Khandesh and parts of Ahmadnagar
were annexed. In the last years of his reign Akbar was
distracted by the rebellion of Prince Salim, the future
Emperor Jahangir.
48
2017-18Jahangir 1605-1627
Military campaigns started by Akbar continued.
The Sisodiya ruler of Mewar, Amar Singh, accepted
Mughal service. Less successful campaigns against
the Sikhs, the Ahoms and Ahmadnagar followed.
Prince Khurram, the future Emperor Shah Jahan,
rebelled in the last years of his reign. The efforts of
Nur Jahan, Jahangir’s wife, to marginalise him were
unsuccessful.
Shah Jahan 1627-1658
Mughal campaigns continued in the Deccan under
Shah Jahan. The Afghan noble Khan Jahan Lodi
rebelled and was defeated. Campaigns were launched
against Ahmadnagar; the Bundelas were defeated and
Orchha seized. In the north-west, the campaign to seize
Balkh from the Uzbegs was unsuccessful and
Qandahar was lost to the Safavids. In 1632
Ahmadnagar was finally annexed and the Bijapur
forces sued for peace. In 1657-1658, there was conflict
over succession amongst Shah Jahan’s sons.
Aurangzeb was victorious and his three brothers,
including Dara Shukoh, were killed. Shah Jahan was
imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra.
Aurangzeb 1658-1707
(1) In the north-east, the Ahoms were defeated in 1663, but rebelled again in
the 1680s. Campaigns in the north-west against the Yusufzai and the Sikhs
were temporarily successful. Mughal intervention in the
succession and internal politics of the Rathor Rajputs of
Marwar led to their rebellion. Campaigns against the
Maratha chieftain Shivaji were initially successful. But
Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji who escaped from Agra,
declared himself an independent king and resumed his
campaigns against the Mughals. Prince Akbar rebelled
against Aurangzeb and received support from the
Marathas and the Deccan Sultanate. He finally fled to
Safavid Iran.
(2) After Akbar’s rebellion Aurangzeb sent armies against
the Deccan Sultanates. Bijapur was annexed in 1685 and
Golconda in 1687. From 1698 Aurangzeb personally
managed campaigns in the Deccan against the Marathas
who started guerrilla warfare. Aurangzeb also had to face the
rebellion in north India of the Sikhs, Jats and Satnamis, in the north-east
of the Ahoms and in the Deccan of the Marathas. His death was followed
by a succession conflict amongst his sons.

The Mughals did not believe in the rule of primogeniture,
where the eldest son inherited his father’s estate. Instead
they followed the Mughal and Timurid custom of
coparcenary inheritance, or a division of the inheritance
amongst all the sons. Follow the highlighted passages
in Table 1, and note the evidence for rebellions
by Mughal princes. Which do you think is a fairer
division of inheritance: primogeniture or coparcenary ?
Mughal Relations with Other Rulers
Take a look at Table 1 once again. You will notice that
the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against
rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as
the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also
joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good
example of this. Many of them married their daughters
into Mughal families and received high positions. But
many resisted as well.
50
2017-18The Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept
Mughal authority for a long time. Once defeated,
however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals,
given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan
jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not
humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to
extend their influence over many kings and chieftains.
But it was difficult to keep this balance all the time.
Look at Table 1 again – note that Aurangzeb insulted
Shivaji when he came to accept Mughal authority. What
was the consequence of this insult?
Mansabdars and Jagirdars
As the empire expanded to encompass different
regions the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of
people. From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles
(Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian
Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other
groups. Those who joined Mughal service were
enrolled as mansabdars.
The term mansabdar refers to an individual who
holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank. It was a
grading system used by the Mughals to fix (1) rank,
(2) salary and (3) military responsibilities. Rank and
salary were determined by a numerical value called zat.
The higher the zat, the more prestigious was the noble’s
position in court and the larger his salary.
The mansabdar’s military responsibilities required
him to maintain a specified number of sawar or
cavalrymen. The mansabdar brought his cavalrymen
for review, got them registered, their horses branded
and then received money to pay them as salary.
Mansabdars received their salaries as revenue
assignments called jagirs which were somewhat like
iqtas. But unlike muqtis, most mansabdars did not
actually reside in or administer their jagirs. They only
had rights to the revenue of their assignments which
was collected for them by their servants while the

Details from a

Jahan’s reign depicting
corruption in his
father’s administration:
(1) a corrupt officer
receiving a bribe and
(2) a tax-collector
punishing poor
peasants.
In Akbar’s reign these
jagirs were
carefully
assessed so that their
revenues were roughly
equal to the salary of the
mansabdar. By Aurangzeb’s
reign this was no longer the
case and the actual revenue
collected was often less than the granted sum. There
was also a huge increase in the number of mansabdars,
which meant a long wait before they received a jagir.
These and other factors created a shortage in the
number of jagirs. As a result, many jagirdars tried
to extract as much revenue as possible while they had
a jagir. Aurangzeb was unable to control these
developments in the last years of his reign and the
peasantry therefore suffered tremendously.
Zabt and Zamindars
The main source of income available to Mughal rulers
was tax on the produce of the peasantry. In most places,
peasants paid taxes through the rural elites, that is,
the headman or the local chieftain. The Mughals
used one term – zamindars – to describe all
intermediaries, whether they were local headmen
of villages or powerful chieftains.
Akbar’s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried
out a careful survey of crop yields, prices and
areas cultivated for a 10-year period, 1570-
1580. On the basis of this data, tax was fixed
on each crop in cash. Each province was
divided into revenue circles with its own
schedule of revenue rates for individual
crops. This revenue system was known as
zabt. It was prevalent in those areas where
Mughal administrators could survey the land
OUR PASTS
– II
52
2017-18and keep very careful accounts. This was not possible
in provinces such as Gujarat and Bengal.
In some areas the zamindars exercised a great deal
of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators
could drive them to rebellion. Sometimes zamindars
and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling against
Mughal authority. These peasant revolts challenged the
stability of the Mughal Empire from the end of the
seventeenth century.
Akbar Nama and Ain-i Akbari
Akbar ordered one of his close friends and
courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of his
reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history
of Akbar’s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first
volume dealt with Akbar’s ancestors and the
second volume recorded the events of
Akbar’s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i
Akbari. It deals with Akbar’s administration,
household, army, the revenues and the
geography of his empire. It also provides rich
details about the traditions and culture of the
people living in India. The most interesting
aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich
statistical details about things as diverse as
crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues.

A Closer Look: Akbar’s Policies
The broad features of administration were laid down
by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl
in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last
volume, the Ain-i Akbari.
Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided
into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar
who carried out both political and military functions.
Each province also had a financial officer or diwan.
For the maintenance of peace and order in his
province, the subadar was supported by other officers

Mehrunnisa married the Emperor Jahangir in
1611 and received the title Nur Jahan. She

to the monarch. As a mark of honour,

titles on one side and on the other the
inscription “struck in the name of the Queen
Begum, Nur Jahan”.

Akbar’s nobles commanded large armies and had
access to large amounts of revenue. While they were
loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of
the seventeenth century many nobles had built
independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to
the empire were weakened by their own self-interest.
While Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s
he started discussions on religion with the ulama,
Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics,
and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the
ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and
social customs of different people. Akbar’s interaction
with people of different faiths made him realise that
religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma
were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions
and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually

led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or “universal peace”.
This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between
people of different religions in his realm. Instead it
focused on a system of ethics – honesty, justice, peace
– that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped
Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this
idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was
followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well.
Sulh-i kul
Jahangir, Akbar’s son, described his father’s policy of
sulh-i kul in the following words:
As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room
for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so ... in his
Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by
the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions,
and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was
closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians
and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the
principle of “universal peace” ( sulh-i kul).
55
THE MUGHAL EMPIRE
2017-18The Mughal Empire in the
Seventeenth Century and After
The administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal
Empire led to great economic and commercial
prosperity. International travellers described it as the
fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also
appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by
side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were
glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah
Jahan’s reign inform us that the highest-ranking
mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of
8,000. This small number – a mere 5.6 per cent of the
total number of mansabdars – received 61.5 per cent
of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries
for themselves and their troopers.
The Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent
a great deal of their income on salaries and goods.
This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry
who supplied them with goods and produce. But the
scale of revenue collection left very little for investment
in the hands of the primary producers – the peasant
and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived
from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider
investing in additional resources – tools and supplies
– to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and
artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited
in this economic world.
The enormous wealth and resources commanded
by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful
group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the
authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his
servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the
regions. They constituted new dynasties and held
command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh.
Although they continued to recognise the Mughal
emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth
century the provinces of the empire had consolidated
their independent political identities. We will read more
about them in Chapter 10.

There were several great monarchs – all near-contemporaries – in
different parts of the world in the sixteenth century.
These included the ruler of Ottoman Turkey, Sultan Suleyman
1520-1566. During his rule the Ottoman state expanded into Europe,
seizing Hungary and besieging Austria. His armies also seized
Baghdad and Iraq. Much of north Africa, all the way into Morocco,
acknowledged Ottoman authority. Suleyman also reconstructed the
Ottoman navy. Its domination over the eastern Mediterranean
brought the navy into competition with Spain. In the Arabian Sea it
challenged the Portuguese. The monarch was given the title of “al-
Qanuni” (the “lawgiver”) because of the large number of regulations
(qanun) passed during his reign. These were aimed to standardise
administrative procedures throughout the expanding domains of the
empire and specifically to protect the peasantry from forced labour
and extraordinary taxes. Later, in the seventeenth century, when public
order declined in the Ottoman domains, the reign of Suleyman Qanuni
was remembered as a period of ideal governance.

mosques and wells. However, domestic architecture –

columns, a style of architecture called “trabeate” or
“corbelled”. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries
the trabeate style was used in the construction of
temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to
large stepped-wells (baolis).

The Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara
amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because
there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top
of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects
built an inclined path to the top of the temple,
placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all
the way to the top. The path started more than
4 km away so that it would not be too steep.
This was dismantled after the temple was
constructed. But the residents of the area
remembered the experience of the
construction of the temple for a long
time. Even now a village near the
temple is called Charupallam, the
“Village of the Incline”.

2017-18Two technological and
stylistic developments are

the superstructure above

which, when mixed with
stone chips hardened
into concrete. This made
construction of large
structures easier and

Building Temples, Mosques and Tanks
Temples and mosques were beautifully constructed
because they were places of worship. They were also
meant to demonstrate the power, wealth and
devotion of the patron. Take the example of the
Rajarajeshvara temple. An inscription mentions that
it was built by King Rajarajadeva for the worship of
his god, Rajarajeshvaram. Notice how the names

of the ruler and the god are very similar. The king
took the god’s name because it was auspicious and
he wanted to appear like a god. Through the rituals
of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva)
honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram).
The largest temples were all constructed by kings.
The other, lesser deities in the temple were gods and
goddesses of the allies and subordinates of the ruler.
The temple was a miniature model of the world ruled
by the king and his allies. As they worshipped their
deities together in the royal temples, it seemed as if
they brought the just rule of the gods on earth.
Muslim Sultans and Padshahs did not claim to be
incarnations of god but Persian court chronicles
described the Sultan as the “Shadow of God”. An
inscription in the Quwwat al-Islam mosque explained
that God chose Alauddin as a king because he had the
qualities of Moses and Solomon, the great lawgivers of
the past. The greatest lawgiver and architect was God
Himself. He created the world out of chaos and
introduced order and symmetry.

2017-18As each new dynasty came to power, kings wanted
to emphasise their moral right to be rulers. Constructing
places of worship provided rulers with the chance to
proclaim their close relationship with God, especially
important in an age of rapid political change. Rulers
also offered patronage to the learned and pious, and
tried to transform their capitals and cities into great
cultural centres that brought fame to their rule and
their realm.
It was widely believed that the rule of a just king
would be an age of plenty
when the heavens would not
withhold rain. At the same
time, making precious water
available by constructing tanks
and reservoirs was highly
praised. Sultan Iltutmish
won universal respect for
constructing a large reservoir
just outside Dehli-i-Kuhna.
It was called the Hauz-i-Sultani
or the “King’s Reservoir”. Can
you find it on Map 1 in Chapter
3? Rulers often constructed
tanks and reservoirs – big and
small – for use by ordinary
people. Sometimes these tanks and reservoirs were part
of a temple, mosque (note the small tank in the Jami
Masjid in Fig. 7) or a gurdwara (a place of worship and
congregation for Sikhs, Fig. 8).
Importance of
water
The Persian terms
abad, populated,
prosperous, and
abadi, flourishing,
are both derived
from the word ab,
meaning water.

Why were Temples Destroyed?
Because kings built temples to demonstrate their
devotion to God and their power and wealth, it is not
surprising that when they attacked one another’s
kingdoms they often targeted these buildings. In the
early ninth century when the Pandyan king Shrimara
Shrivallabha invaded Sri Lanka and defeated the

king, Sena I (831-851), the Buddhist monk and
chronicler Dhammakitti noted: “he removed all the
valuables ... The statue of the Buddha made entirely
of gold in the Jewel Palace ... and the golden images in
the various monasteries – all these he seized.” The blow
to the pride of the Sinhalese ruler had to be avenged
and the next Sinhalese ruler, Sena II, ordered his
general to invade Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas.
The Buddhist chronicler noted that the expedition
made a special effort to find and restore the gold statue
of the Buddha.
Similarly in the early eleventh century, when the
Chola king Rajendra I built a Shiva temple in his capital
he filled it with prized statues seized from defeated
rulers. An incomplete list included: a Sun-pedestal from
the Chalukyas, a Ganesha statue and several statues
of Durga; a Nandi statue from the eastern Chalukyas;
an image of Bhairava (a form of Shiva) and Bhairavi
from the Kalingas of Orissa; and a Kali statue from the
Palas of Bengal.
Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni was a contemporary of
Rajendra I. During his campaigns in the subcontinent
he also attacked the temples of defeated kings and
looted their wealth and idols. Sultan Mahmud was not
a very important ruler at that time. But by destroying
temples – especially the one at Somnath – he tried to
win credit as a great hero of Islam. In the political
culture of the Middle Ages most rulers displayed their
political might and military success by attacking and
looting the places of worship of defeated rulers.

Gardens, Tombs and Forts
Under the Mughals, architecture became more
complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and
especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in
66
2017-18literature, art and architecture.
In his autobiography, Babur
described his interest in
planning and laying out
formal gardens, placed within
rectangular walled enclosures
and divided into four quarters
by artificial channels.
These gardens were called
chahar bagh, four gardens,
because of their symmetrical
division into quarters. Beginning
with Akbar, some of the most
beautiful chahar baghs were
constructed by Jahangir and
Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra
and Delhi (see Fig. 9).
There were several important
architectural innovations
during Akbar’s reign. For
inspiration, Akbar’s architects
turned to the tombs of his
Central Asian ancestor, Timur.
The central towering dome and the tall gateway
(pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal

architecture, first visible in Humayun’s tomb. The tomb
was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh
and built in the tradition known as “eight paradises”
or hasht bihisht – a central hall surrounded by eight
rooms. The building was constructed with red
sandstone, edged with white marble.
It was during Shah Jahan’s reign that the different
elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in
a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a
huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra
and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private
audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned.
Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also
described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls.
Shah Jahan’s audience halls were specially
constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on
which his throne was placed was frequently described
as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer,
since everybody faced that direction when court was in
session. The idea of the king as a representative of God
on earth was suggested by these architectural features.
The connection between royal justice and the
imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his

the emperor’s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays
that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing
the lute. It was believed that Orpheus’s music could
calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together
peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan’s audience
hall aimed to communicate that the king’s justice would
treat the high and the low as equals creating a world
where all could live together in harmony.

In the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan’s capital
was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed
their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These
were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in
the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also
had a variation that historians describe as the “river-
front garden”. In this the dwelling was not located in
the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to
the bank of the river.
Shah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the
layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural
accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble
mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of
the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan

Shukoh – were given access to the river. All others
had to construct their homes in the city away from
the River Yamuna.
Region and Empire
As construction activity increased between the eighth
and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable
sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one
region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for
example, the elephant stables of the rulers were

strongly influenced by the style of architecture found
in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda
(see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples
were constructed in architectural styles that were very
similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri.
The creation of large empires that brought different
regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation
of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers
were particularly skilled in adapting regional
71
RULERS AND BUILDINGS
2017-18architectural styles in the construction of their
own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local
rulers had developed a roof that was designed
to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked
this “Bangla dome” (see Figures 11 and 12 in
Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their
architecture. The impact of other regions was
also evident. In Akbar’s capital at Fatehpur Sikri
many of the buildings show the influence of the
architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa.
Even though the authority of the Mughal
rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the
architectural styles developed under their
patronage were constantly used and adapted
by other rulers whenever they tried to establish
their own kingdoms.
Churches that touched the skies
From the twelfth century onwards, attempts
began in France to build churches that were
taller and lighter than earlier buildings. This
architectural style, known as Gothic, was
distinguished by high pointed arches, the
use of stained glass, often painted with
scenes drawn from the Bible, and flying
buttresses. Tall spires and bell towers which
were visible from a distance were added
to the church.

mandapas or pavilions. Kings hold court in these
mandapas, issuing orders to their subordinates. There
are also barracks for the army.
The town is bustling with markets selling grain,
spices, cloth and jewellery. Water supply for the
town comes from wells and tanks. The Saliya
weavers of Thanjavur and the nearby town of
Uraiyur are busy producing cloth for flags to be

Temples were often central to the economy and society.

2017-18Bronze, bell metal and the
“lost wax” technique
Bronze is an alloy containing copper and
tin. Bell metal contains a greater proportion
of tin than other kinds of bronze. This
produces a bell-like sound.
Chola bronze statues (see Chapter 2)
were made using the “lost wax” technique.
First, an image was made of wax. This was
covered with clay and allowed to dry. Next it
was heated, and a tiny hole was made in the
clay cover. The molten wax was drained out
through this hole. Then molten metal was
poured into the clay mould through the hole.
Once the metal cooled and solidified, the
clay cover was carefully removed, and the
image was cleaned and polished.
?
What do you think were the advantages
of using this technique?
Temple authorities used their wealth to finance
trade and banking. Gradually a large number of
priests, workers, artisans, traders, etc. settled near
the temple to cater to its needs and those of the
pilgrims. Thus grew temple towns. Towns emerged
around temples such as those of Bhillasvamin (Bhilsa
or Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh), and Somnath in
Gujarat. Other important temple towns included
Kanchipuram and Madurai in Tamil Nadu, and
Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.

Pilgrimage centres also slowly developed into

Chauhan kings in the twelfth century and later
became the suba headquarters under the Mughals.

A Network of Small Towns
From the eighth century onwards the subcontinent was
dotted with several small towns. These probably
emerged from large villages. They usually had a
mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby
villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had
market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined
with shops. Besides, there were streets for different
kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar
makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc. While
some traders lived in the town, others travelled from
town to town. Many came from far and near to these
towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant
places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and
spices like pepper.

or by rich merchants. These “rights” were recorded in
inscriptions that have survived to this day.

Traders Big and Small
There were many kinds of traders. These included
the Banjaras (see also Chapter 7). Several traders,

headmen who negotiated on their behalf with warriors
who bought horses.
Since traders had to pass through many kingdoms
and forests, they usually travelled in caravans and
formed guilds to protect their interests. There were
several such guilds in south India from the eighth

There were also communities like the Chettiars and
the Marwari Oswal who went on to become the
principal trading groups of the country. Gujarati
traders, including the communities of Hindu Baniyas
and Muslim Bohras, traded extensively with the ports
of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, East Africa, Southeast
Asia and China. They sold textiles and spices in these
ports and, in exchange, brought gold and ivory from
Africa; and spices, tin, Chinese blue pottery and silver
from Southeast Asia and China.
The towns on the west coast were home to Arab,
Persian, Chinese, Jewish and Syrian Christian traders.
Indian spices and cloth sold in the Red Sea ports were
purchased by Italian traders and eventually reached
European markets, fetching very high profits. Spices
grown in tropical climates (pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg,
dried ginger, etc.) became an important part of
European cooking, and cotton cloth was very attractive.
This eventually drew European traders to India. We
will shortly read about how this changed the face of
trading and towns.
Kabul
With its rugged, mountainous landscape, Kabul (in
present-day Afghanistan) became politically and
commercially important from the sixteenth century
onwards. Kabul and Qandahar were linked to the
celebrated Silk Route. Besides, trade in horses was
primarily carried on through this route. In the
seventeenth century Jean Baptiste Tavernier, a diamond
merchant, estimated that the horse trade at Kabul
amounted to Rs 30,000 annually, which was a huge sum
in those days. Camels carried dried fruits, dates, carpets,
silks and even fresh fruits from Kabul to the subcontinent
and elsewhere. Slaves were also brought here for sale.

buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches,
domes and pillared halls with niches for holding

pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the
lotus and corbels. In its heyday in the fifteenth-
sixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial
and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and
agents of European traders
such as the Portuguese,
thronged the markets of
Hampi.

A Gateway to the West: Surat
Emporium

Surat in Gujarat was the emporium of western trade
during the Mughal period along with Cambay (present-
day Khambat) and somewhat later, Ahmedabad. Surat
was the gateway for trade with West Asia via the Gulf
of Ormuz. Surat has also been called the gate to Mecca
because many pilgrim ships set sail from here.
The city was cosmopolitan and people of all castes
and creeds lived there. In the seventeenth century the
Portuguese, Dutch and English had their factories and
warehouses at Surat. According to the English
chronicler Ovington who wrote an account of the port
in 1689, on average a hundred ships of different
countries could be found anchored at the port at any
given time.

There were also several retail and wholesale shops
selling cotton textiles. The textiles of Surat were famous
for their gold lace borders (zari) and had a market in
West Asia, Africa and Europe. The state built numerous
rest-houses to take care of the needs of people from
all over the world who came to the city. There were
magnificent buildings and innumerable pleasure
parks. The Kathiawad seths or mahajans
(moneychangers) had huge banking houses at Surat.
It is noteworthy that the Surat hundis were honoured
in the far-off markets of Cairo in Egypt, Basra in Iraq
and Antwerp in Belgium.
However, Surat began to decline towards the end of
the seventeenth century. This was because of many
factors: the loss of markets and productivity because

Bombay (present-day Mumbai) where the English East
India Company shifted its headquarters in 1668.
Today, Surat is a bustling commercial centre.
Fishing in Troubled Waters:
Masulipatnam
The town of Masulipatnam or Machlipatnam (literally,
fish port town) lay on the delta of the Krishna river. In
the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity.
Both the Dutch and English East India Companies
attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the
most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at
Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch.
A poor fisher town
This is a description of Masulipatnam by William
Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company,
in 1620:
This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right
Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a
small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse
situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a
poor fisher town ... afterwards, the convenience of the road
(a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for
merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation
frequented this coast.

items to prevent the trade passing completely into the
hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce

2017-18competition among various trading groups – the
Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati
Chettis, and European traders – made the city
populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to
extend their power to Golconda their representative,
the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant,
began to play off the Dutch and the English against
each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb
annexed Golconda.
This caused the European Companies to look for
alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the
English East India Company that it was not enough if
a port had connections with the production centres of
the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was
felt, should combine political, administrative and
commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to
Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras
(present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its
merchants and prosperity and declined in the course
of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more
than a dilapidated little town.
New Towns and Traders
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, European
countries were searching for spices and textiles, which
had become popular both in Europe and West Asia.
The English, Dutch and French formed East India
Companies in order to expand their commercial
activities in the east. Initially great Indian traders like
Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora who owned a large
number of ships competed with them. However, the
European Companies used their naval power to gain
control of the sea trade and forced Indian traders to
work as their agents. Ultimately, the English emerged
as the most successful commercial and political power
in the subcontinent.
The spurt in demand for goods like textiles led to a
great expansion of the crafts of spinning, weaving,
bleaching, dyeing, etc. with more and more people

2017-18taking them up. Indian textile designs became
increasingly refined. However, this period also saw the
decline of the independence of craftspersons. They now
began to work on a system of advances which meant
that they had to weave cloth which was already
promised to European agents. Weavers no longer had
the liberty of selling their own cloth or weaving their
own patterns. They had to reproduce the designs
supplied to them by the Company agents.
The eighteenth century saw the rise of Bombay,
Calcutta and Madras, which are nodal cities today.
Crafts and commerce underwent major changes as
merchants and artisans (such as weavers) were moved
into the Black Towns established by the European
companies within these new cities. The “blacks” or
native traders and craftspersons were confined here
while the “white” rulers occupied the superior
residencies of Fort St. George in Madras or Fort St.
William in Calcutta. The story of crafts and commerce
in the eighteenth century will be taken up next year.

In the fifteenth century European sailors undertook unprecedented
explorations of sea routes. They were driven by the desire to find
ways of reaching the Indian subcontinent and obtaining spices.
Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese sailor, sailed down the African
Coast, went round the Cape of Good Hope and crossed over to
the Indian Ocean . His first journey took more than a year; he
reached Calicut in 1498, and returned to Lisbon, the capital of
Portugal, the following year. He lost two of
his four ships, and of the 170 men at the
start of the journey, only 54 survived. In
spite of the obvious hazards, the routes
that were opened up proved to be
extremely profitable – and he was
followed by English, Dutch and
French sailors.
The search for sea routes to
India had another, unexpected
fallout. On the assumption that
the earth was round, Christopher
Columbus, an Italian, decided to sail
westwards across the Atlantic
Ocean to find a route to India. He
landed in the West Indies (which
got their name because of this
confusion) in 1492. He was
followed
by

Portugal, who occupied large parts
of Central and South America, often

TRIBES, NOMADS AND
SETTLED COMMUNITIES
Y
ou saw in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 how kingdoms
rose and fell. Even as this was happening, new
arts, crafts and production activities flourished in
towns and villages. Over the centuries important
political, social and economic developments had
taken place. But social change was not
the same everywhere, because different
kinds of societies evolved differently. It is
important to understand how, and why,
this happened.
Fig. 1
Tribal dance,
Santal painted scroll.
In large parts of the subcontinent, society
was already divided according to the rules
of varna. These rules, as prescribed by the
Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers of
large kingdoms. The difference between the
high and low, and between the rich and poor,
increased. Under the Delhi Sultans and the
Mughals, this hierarchy between social
classes grew further.
Beyond Big Cities: Tribal
Societies
There were, however, other kinds of
societies as well. Many societies in the
subcontinent did not follow the social rules
and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas.
Nor were they divided into numerous
unequal classes. Such societies are often
called tribes.
91
TRIBES , NOMADS AND
SETTLED COMMUNITIES
2017-18Members of each tribe were united by kinship bonds.
Many tribes obtained their livelihood from agriculture.
Others were hunter-gatherers or herders. Most often
they combined these activities to make full use of the
natural resources of the area in which they lived. Some
tribes were nomadic and moved from one place to
another. A tribal group controlled land and pastures
jointly, and divided these amongst households
according to its own rules.
?
Many large tribes thrived in different parts of the
subcontinent. They usually lived in forests, hills,
deserts and places difficult to reach. Sometimes they
clashed with the more powerful caste-based societies.
In various ways, the tribes retained their freedom and
preserved their separate culture.
On a physical
map of the
subcontinent,
identify the areas
in which tribal
people may have
lived.
But the caste-based and tribal societies also
depended on each other for their diverse needs. This
relationship, of conflict and dependence, gradually
caused both societies to change.
Who were Tribal People?
Contemporary historians and travellers give very
scanty information about tribes. A few exceptions
apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But
they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These
were passed down to each new generation. Present-
day historians have started using such oral traditions
to write tribal histories.
Tribal people were found in almost every region of
the subcontinent. The area and influence of a tribe
varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes
controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar
tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more
important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was
made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. In
Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated
extensive regions before they were subdued by the
Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful

smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western
Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The
distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was
entirely dominated by tribes – the Nagas, Ahoms and
many others.
In many areas of pr esent-day Bihar and
Jharkhand, Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the
twelfth century. Raja Man Singh, Akbar’s famous
general, attacked and defeated the Cheros in 1591.
A large amount of booty was taken from them, but
they were not entirely subdued. Under Aurangzeb,
Mughal forces captured many Chero fortresses and
subjugated the tribe. The Mundas and Santals were
among the other important tribes that lived in this
region and also in Orissa and Bengal.

The large tribe of Bhils was
spread across western and central
India. By the late sixteenth century,
many of them had become settled
agriculturists and some even
zamindars. Many Bhil clans,
nevertheless, remained hunter-
gatherers. The Gonds were found

They lived on milk and other

settled agriculturists for grain,
cloth, utensils and other products.

2017-18They bought and sold these goods as they moved
from one place to another, transporting them on their

The Banjaras were the most important trader-
nomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan
Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to
transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir
wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain
on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in
towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal
army during military campaigns. With a large army
there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain.
The Banjaras
Peter Mundy, an English trader who came to India
during the early seventeenth century, has described
the Banjaras:
In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen.
They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ...
These Banjaras carry their household – wives and children –
along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their
way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously
travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are
sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are
themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply
available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there,
they again reload their oxen with anything that can be
profitably sold in other places ... In a tanda there may be as
many as 6 or 7 hundred persons ... They do not travel more
than 6 or 7 miles a day – that, too, in the cool weather. After
unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is
enough land here, and no one there to forbid them.

mendicants acted as
wandering merchants. There were castes of
entertainers who performed in different towns and
villages for their livelihood.

Changing Society: New Castes and
Hierarchies
As the economy and the needs of society grew, people
with new skills were required. Smaller castes, or jatis,
emerged within varnas. For example, new castes
appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other
hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into
caste-based society and given the status of jatis.
Specialised artisans – smiths, carpenters and masons
– were also recognised as separate jatis by the
Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the
basis for organising society.
Deliberations on jati
A twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar,
in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu),
describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of
Brahmanas.
They deliberated on the status of a group known as
rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down
their occupations, which were to include architecture,
building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for
temples with images in them, preparing wooden
equipment used to perform sacrifices, building
mandapas, making jewels for the king.

2017-18Among the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became
powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They
belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas,
Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too,
had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to
be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the
older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a
developed society was emerging, and rulers used their
wealth to create powerful states.
The rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set
an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually,
with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes
became part of the caste system. But only the leading
tribal families could join the ruling class. A large
majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the
other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and
the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early.
They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal
social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was
not widely accepted in these areas.
The emergence of states is closely related to social
change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this
important part of our history are described below.
A Closer Look
The Gonds
The Gonds lived in a vast forested region called
Gondwana – or “country inhabited by Gonds”. They
practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe
was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan
had its own raja or rai. About the time that the power
of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond
kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller
Gond chiefs. The Akbar Nama, a history of Akbar’s
reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga
that had 70,000 villages.

The administrative system of these kingdoms was

2017-18garhs. Each garh was controlled
by a particular Gond clan. This
was further divided into units of
84 villages called chaurasi. The
chaurasi was subdivided into
barhots which were made up of
12 villages each.
The emergence of large states
changed the nature of Gond
society. Their basically equal
society gradually got divided
into unequal social classes.
Brahmanas received land grants
from the Gond rajas and became
more influential. The Gond chiefs
now wished to be recognised as
Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the Gond
raja of Garha Katanga, assumed
the title of Sangram Shah. His
son, Dalpat, married princess
Durgawati, the daughter of
Salbahan, the Chandel
Rajput raja of Mahoba.

Dalpat, however, died
early. Rani Durgawati
was very capable, and
started ruling on behalf
of her five-year-old son,
Bir Narain. Under her, the
kingdom became even
more extensive. In 1565,
the Mughal forces under
Asaf Khan attacked
Garha Katanga. A strong
resistance was put up by
Rani Durgawati. She was
defeated and preferred
to die rather than
surrender. Her son, too,
died fighting soon after.
98
2017-18Garha Katanga was a rich state. It earned much
wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other
kingdoms. When the Mughals defeated the Gonds, they
captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants.
They annexed part of the kingdom and granted the rest
to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain. Despite the
fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for
some time. However, they became much weaker and
later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger
Bundelas and Marathas.
?
Discuss why the
Mughals were
interested in the
land of the Gonds.
The Ahoms
The Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from
present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. They
created a new state by suppressing the older political
system of the bhuiyans (landlords). During the
sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of the
Chhutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and
subjugated many other tribes. The Ahoms built a large
state, and for this they used firearms as early as the
1530s. By the 1660s they could even make high-
quality gunpowder and cannons.
However, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the
south-west. In 1662, the
Mughals under Mir Jumla
attacked the Ahom kingdom.
Despite their brave defence, the
Ahoms were defeated. But
direct Mughal control over the
region could not last long.

Tribes of eastern

The Ahom state depended
upon forced labour. Those
forced to work for the state were

population was taken. Each
village had to send a number

were shifted to less populated

2017-18places. Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the first
half of the seventeenth century the administration
became quite centralised.
Almost all adult males served in the army during
war. At other times, they were engaged in building
dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The
Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation.
Fig. 7
Ear ornaments, Koboi
Naga tribe, Manipur.
Ahom society was divided into clans or khels. There
were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the
Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A khel
often controlled several villages. The peasant was given
land by his village community. Even the king could
not take it away without the community’s consent.
Originally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal
gods. During the first half of the seventeenth century,
however, the influence of Brahmanas increased.
Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the
king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714-1744), Hinduism
became the predominant religion. But the Ahom
kings did not completely give up their traditional
beliefs after adopting Hinduism.
?
Ahom society was very sophisticated. Poets and
scholars were given land grants. Theatre was
encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were
translated into the local language. Historical works,
known as buranjis, were also written – first in the Ahom
language and then in Assamese.
Why do you think
the Mughals tried
to conquer the
land of the
Ahoms?
Conclusion
Considerable social change took place in the
subcontinent during the period we have been examining.
Varna-based society and tribal people constantly
interacted with each other. This interaction caused both
kinds of societies to adapt and change. There were many
different tribes and they took up diverse livelihoods.
Over a period of time, many of them merged with caste-
based society. Others, however, rejected both the caste
system and orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established

he was the ruler of extensive territories. His successors created a

or even repeating the name of God in silence, and
noticed that some of them are moved to tears. Such
intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various
kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved
since the eighth century.
The Idea of a Supreme God
Before large kingdoms emerged, different groups
of people worshipped their own gods and goddesses.
As people were brought together through the growth
of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to
develop. The idea that all living things pass through
countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good
deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly,
the idea that all human beings are not equal even at
birth gained ground during this period. The belief that
social privileges came from birth in a “noble” family or
a “high” caste was the subject of many learned texts.
Many people were uneasy with such ideas and
turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas
according to which it was possible to overcome social
differences and break the cycle of rebirth through
personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a
Supreme God who could deliver humans from such
bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). This
idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity
in the early centuries of the Common Era.

process, local myths and legends became a part of the
Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended
in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults.
Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was
possible for devotees to receive the grace of God
regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti
became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas
adopted these beliefs.
A New Kind of Bhakti in South India –
Nayanars and Alvars
The seventh to ninth centuries saw the emergence of
new religious movements, led by the Nayanars (saints
devoted to Shiva) and Alvars (saints devoted to Vishnu)
who came from all castes including those considered
“untouchable” like the Pulaiyar and the Panars. They
were sharply critical of the Buddhists and Jainas and
preached ardent love of Shiva or Vishnu as the path
to salvation. They drew upon the ideals of love and
heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the earliest
example of Tamil literature, composed during the early
centuries of the Common Era) and blended them with
the values of bhakti. The Nayanars and Alvars went
from place to place composing exquisite poems in
praise of the deities enshrined in the villages they
visited, and set them to music.

There were 63 Nayanars, who belonged to different
caste backgrounds such as potters, “untouchable”
workers, peasants, hunters, soldiers, Brahmanas and
chiefs. The best known among them were Appar,
Sambandar, Sundarar and Manikkavasagar. There are
two sets of compilations of their songs – Tevaram and
Tiruvacakam.
There were 12 Alvars, who came from equally
divergent backgrounds, the best known being
Periyalvar, his daughter Andal, Tondaradippodi Alvar
and Nammalvar. Their songs were compiled in the Divya
Prabandham.
Hagiography
Writing of saints’

Between the tenth and twelfth centuries the Chola
and Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many
of the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening
the links between the bhakti tradition and temple
worship. This was also the time when their poems were
compiled. Besides, hagiographies or religious
biographies of the Alvars and Nayanars were also
composed. Today we use these texts as sources for
writing histories of the bhakti tradition.

2017-18Philosophy and Bhakti
Shankara, one of the most influential philosophers
of India, was born in Kerala in the eighth century.
He was an advocate of Advaita or the doctrine of the
oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme God
which is the Ultimate Reality. He taught that
Brahman, the only or Ultimate Reality, was formless
and without any attributes. He considered the world
around us to be an illusion or maya, and preached
renunciation of the world and adoption of the path
of knowledge to understand the true nature of
Brahman and attain salvation.
Ramanuja, born in Tamil Nadu in the eleventh
century, was deeply influenced by the Alvars.
According to him the best means of attaining
salvation was through intense devotion to Vishnu.
Vishnu in His grace helps the devotee to attain the
bliss of union with Him. He propounded the doctrine
of Vishishtadvaita or qualified oneness in that the
soul even when united with the Supreme God
remained distinct. Ramanuja’s doctrine greatly
inspired the new strand of bhakti which developed
in north India subsequently.

Basavanna’s Virashaivism
We noted earlier the connection between the Tamil
bhakti movement and temple worship. This in turn
led to a reaction that is best represented in the
Virashaiva movement initiated by Basavanna and
his companions like Allama Prabhu and
Akkamahadevi. This movement began in Karnataka
in the mid-twelfth century. The Virashaivas argued
strongly for the equality of all human beings and
against Brahmanical ideas about caste and the
treatment of women. They were also against all forms
of ritual and idol worship.

The Saints of Maharashtra
From the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries
Maharashtra saw a great number of saint-poets, whose
songs in simple Marathi continue to inspire people.
The most important among them were Jnaneshwar,
Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well as women like
Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela, who belonged
to the “untouchable” Mahar caste. This regional
tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a form of
Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on the notion
of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people.
These saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism,
outward display of piety and social differences based
on birth. In fact they even rejected the idea of
renunciation and preferred to live with their families,
earning their livelihood like any other person, while
humbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new

2017-18Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis
A number of religious groups that
emerged during this period criticised the
ritual and other aspects of conventional
religion and the social order, using
simple, logical arguments. Among them
were the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas and
Yogis. They advocated renunciation of
the world. To them the path to salvation
lay in meditation on the formless
Ultimate Reality and the realisation of
oneness with it. To achieve this they
advocated intense training of the mind
and body through practices like
yogasanas, breathing exercises and
meditation. These groups became
particularly popular among “low” castes.
Their criticism of conventional religion
created the ground for devotional religion
to become a popular force in northern
India.

Islam and Sufism
The sants had much in common with the Sufis, so
much so that it is believed that they adopted many
ideas of each other. Sufis were Muslim mystics. They
rejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and
devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow
human beings.
Islam propagated strict monotheism or submission
to one God. In the eighth and ninth centuries religious
scholars developed different aspects of the Holy Law
(Shariat) and theology of Islam. While the religion of
Islam gradually became more complex, Sufis provided
it with an additional dimension that favoured a more
personal devotion to God. The Sufis often rejected the
elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded
by Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with
God much as a lover seeks his beloved with a

too composed poems expressing their feelings, and a
rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and
fables, developed around them. Among the great Sufis
of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like
the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too
believed that the heart can be trained to look at the
world in a different way. They developed elaborate
methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or
sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs
(dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc.

the silsilas, a spiritual genealogy of Sufi teachers, each

Jalaluddin Rumi was a great thirteenth-century Sufi poet
from Iran who wrote in Persian. Here is an excerpt from
his work:
He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu
temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on
the heights or in the lowlands ... I went to the Kaaba of
Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna
the philosopher. He was beyond the range of Avicenna ... I
looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was
in no other place.
New Religious Developments in North
India
The period after the thirteenth century saw a new wave
of the bhakti movement in north India. This was an
age when Islam, Brahmanical Hinduism, Sufism,
various strands of bhakti, and the Nathpanths,
Siddhas and Yogis influenced one another. We saw that
new towns (Chapter 6) and kingdoms (Chapters 2, 3
and 4) were emerging, and people were taking up new
professions and finding new roles for themselves. Such
people, especially craftspersons, peasants, traders and
labourers, thronged to listen to these
new saints and spread their ideas.

was an ardent devotee of Krishna. His compositions,
compiled in the Sursagara, Surasaravali and Sahitya
Lahari, express his devotion. Also contemporary was
Shankaradeva of Assam (late fifteenth century) who
emphasised devotion to Vishnu, and composed poems
and plays in Assamese. He began the practice of setting
up namghars or houses of recitation and prayer, a
practice that continues to date.
This tradition also included saints like Dadu Dayal,
Ravidas and Mirabai. Mirabai was a Rajput princess
married into the royal family of Mewar in the sixteenth
century. Mirabai became a disciple of Ravidas, a saint
from a caste considered “untouchable”. She was

expressing her intense devotion. Her songs also openly
challenged the norms of the “upper” castes and became
popular with the masses in Rajasthan and Gujarat.
A unique feature of most of the saints is that their
works were composed in regional languages and could
be sung. They became immensely popular and were
handed down orally from generation to generation.
Usually the poorest, most deprived communities and
women transmitted these songs, often adding their
own experiences. Thus the songs as we have them
today are as much a creation of the saints as of
generations of people who sang them. They have
become a part of our living popular culture.

2017-18A Closer Look: Kabir
Kabir, who probably lived in the fifteenth-sixteenth
centuries, was one of the most influential saints. He
was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or
weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi).
We have little reliable information about his life. We
get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses
called sakhis and pads said to have been composed
by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some
of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru
Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak.
In search of the True Lord
Here is a composition of Kabir:
O Allah-Ram present in all living beings
Have mercy on your servants, O Lord!
Why bump your head on the ground,
Why bathe your body in water?
You kill and you call yourself “humble”
But your vices you conceal.
Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps
the ekadasi fast
While the Qazi observes the Ramzan
Tell me why does he set aside the eleven
months
To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth?
Hari dwells in the East, they say
And Allah resides in the West,
Search for him in your heart, in the heart
of your heart;
There he dwells, Rahim-Ram.

In what ways are the ideas in this poem similar to or
different from those of Basavanna and Jalaluddin Rumi?
116
2017-18Kabir’s teachings were based on a complete, indeed
vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions.
His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external
worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam,
the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste
system. The language of his poetry was a form of
spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people.
He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is
difficult to follow.
Kabir believed in a formless Supreme God and
preached that the only path to salvation was through
bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among
both Hindus and Muslims.
A Closer Look: Baba Guru Nanak
We know more about Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) than
about Kabir. Born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib in
Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a centre
at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). A
regular worship that consisted of the singing of his own
hymns was established there
for his followers. Irrespective of
their former creed, caste or
gender, his followers ate
together in the common kitchen
(langar). The sacred space thus
created by Baba Guru Nanak
was known as dharmsal. It is
now known as Gurdwara.
Before his death in 1539,
Baba Guru Nanak appointed
one of his followers as his
successor. His name was Lehna
but he came to be known as
Guru Angad, signifying that
he was a part of Baba Guru
Nanak himself. Guru Angad
compiled the compositions
of Baba Guru Nanak, to
which he added his own in

three successors of Guru Angad also
wrote under the name of “Nanak” and
all of their compositions were compiled
by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this
compilation were added the writings of
other figures like Shaikh Farid, Sant
Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh
Bahadur. In 1706 this compilation was
authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur’s
son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh.
It is now known as Guru Granth Sahib,
the holy scripture of the Sikhs.
The number of Baba Guru Nanak’s
followers increased through the sixteenth century
under his successors. They belonged to a number
of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and
craftsmen predominated. This may have something
to do with Baba Guru Nanak’s insistence that his
followers must be householders and should adopt
productive and useful occupations. They were also
expected to contribute to the general funds of the
community of followers.

An early manuscript
of the Guru Granth

By the beginning of the seventeenth century the town
of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around the
central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden
Temple). It was virtually self-governing and modern
historians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh
community as ‘a state within the state’. The Mughal
emperor Jahangir looked upon them as a potential
threat and he ordered the execution of Guru Arjan in
1606. The Sikh movement began to get politicised in
the seventeenth century, a development which
culminated in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru
Gobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs,
called the Khalsa Panth, became a political entity.

2017-18Martin Luther and the Reformation
The sixteenth century was a time of religious ferment in Europe
as well. One of the most important leaders of the changes that
took place within Christianity was Martin Luther (1483-1546).
Luther felt that several practices in the Roman Catholic Church
went against the teachings of the
Bible. He encouraged the use of
the language of ordinary people
rather than Latin, and translated
the Bible into German. Luther was
strongly opposed to the practice
of “indulgences” or making
donations to the Church so as to
gain forgiveness from sins. His
writings were widely disseminated
with the growing use of the
printing press. Many Protestant
Christian sects trace their origins
to the teachings of Luther.
Baba Guru Nanak had a huge impact on this
development from the very beginning. He emphasised
the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted
that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining
liberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state
of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with a
strong sense of social commitment. He himself used
the terms nam, dan and isnan for the essence of his
teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare
of others and purity of conduct. His teachings are now
remembered as nam-japna, kirt-karna and vand-
chhakna, which also underline the importance of right
belief and worship, honest living, and helping others.
Thus, Baba Guru Nanak’s idea of equality had social
and political implications. This might partly explain the
difference between the history of the followers of Baba
Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of the other
religious figures of the medieval centuries, like Kabir,
Ravidas and Dadu whose ideas were very similar to
those of Baba Guru Nanak.

THE MAKING OF
REGIONAL CULTURES
O
ne of the commonest ways of describing people
is in terms of the language they speak. When we
refer to a person as a Tamil or an Oriya, this usually
means that he or she speaks Tamil or Oriya and lives
in Tamil Nadu or Orissa. We also tend to associate
each region with distinctive kinds of food, clothes,
poetry, dance, music and painting. Sometimes we take
these identities for granted and assume that they have
existed from time immemorial. However, the frontiers
separating regions have evolved over time (and in fact
are still changing). Also, what we understand as
regional cultures today are often the product of complex
processes of intermixing of local traditions with ideas
from other parts of the subcontinent. As we will see,
some traditions appear specific to some regions, others
seem to be similar across regions, and yet others derive
from older practices in a particular area, but take a
new form in other regions.

Let us begin by looking at an example of the
connection between language and region. The Chera
kingdom of Mahodayapuram was established in the
ninth century in the south-western part of the
peninsula, part of present-day Kerala. It is likely that
Malayalam was spoken in this area. The rulers
introduced the Malayalam language and script in their
inscriptions. In fact, this is one of the earliest
examples of the use of a regional language in official
records in the subcontinent.

inscription, composed

At the same time, the Cheras also drew upon
Sanskritic traditions. The temple theatre of Kerala,
which is traced to this period, borrowed stories from
the Sanskrit epics. The first literary works in
Malayalam, dated to about the twelfth century, are
directly indebted to Sanskrit. Interestingly enough, a
fourteenth-century text, the Lilatilakam, dealing with
grammar and poetics, was composed in Manipravalam
– literally, “diamonds and corals” referring to the two
languages, Sanskrit and the regional language.
Rulers and Religious Traditions:
The Jagannatha Cult
In other regions, regional cultures grew around
religious traditions. The best example of this process
is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world,
a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To
date, the local tribal people make the
wooden image of the deity, which
suggests that the deity was originally
a local god, who was later identified
with Vishnu.

as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority

Orissa, such as the Mughals, the

The Rajputs and
Traditions of Heroism
In the nineteenth century, the
region that constitutes most of
present-day Rajasthan, was called
Rajputana by the British. While this
may suggest that this was an area that was inhabited
only or mainly by Rajputs, this is only partly true.
There were (and are) several groups who identify
themselves as Rajputs in many areas of northern and
central India. And of course, there are several peoples
other than Rajputs who live in Rajasthan. However,
the Rajputs are often recognised as contributing to
the distinctive culture of Rajasthan.

eighth century, most of
the present-day state of
Rajasthan was ruled by
various Rajput families.
Prithviraj (Chapter 2) was
one such ruler. These rulers

poems and songs, which were recited by specially
trained minstrels. These preserved the memories of
heroes and were expected to inspire others to follow
their example. Ordinary people were also attracted by
these stories – which often depicted dramatic situations,
and a range of strong emotions – loyalty, friendship,
love, valour, anger, etc.
Did women find a place within these stories?
Sometimes, they figure as the “cause” for conflicts, as
men fought with one another to either “win” or “protect”
women. Women are also depicted as following their
heroic husbands in both life and death – there are
stories about the practice of sati or the immolation of
widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So those

Beyond Regional Frontiers:
The Story of Kathak
If heroic traditions can be found in different regions in
different forms, the same is true of dance. Let us look
at the history of one dance form, Kathak, now
associated with several parts of north India. The term
kathak is derived from katha, a word used in Sanskrit
and other languages for story. The kathaks were
originally a caste of story-tellers in temples of north
India, who embellished their performances with
gestures and songs. Kathak began evolving into a
distinct mode of dance in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries with the spread of the bhakti movement. The
legends of Radha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays
called rasa lila, which combined folk dance with the
basic gestures of the kathak story-tellers.
Under the Mughal emperors and their nobles, Kathak
was performed in the court, where it acquired its present
features and developed into a form of dance with a
distinctive style. Subsequently, it developed in two
traditions or gharanas: one in the courts of Rajasthan
(Jaipur) and the other in Lucknow. Under the patronage
of Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh,
it grew into a major art form. By the third quarter
of the nineteenth
century it was firmly
entrenched as a dance
form not only in these
two regions, but in
the adjoining areas
of present-day Punjab,
Haryana,
Jammu
and Kashmir, Bihar
and Madhya Pradesh.

enactment of stories.
Kathak, like several other cultural practices, was
viewed with disfavour by most British administrators
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, it
survived and continued to be performed by courtesans,
and was recognised as one of six “classical” forms of
dance in the country after independence.
“Classical” dances
The question of defining any art form as “classical” is
often quite complicated. Do we define something as
classical if it deals with a religious theme? Or do
we consider it classical because it appears to
require a great deal of skill acquired
through long years of training? Or is it
classical because it is performed
according to rules that are laid down,
and variations are not encouraged?
These are questions we need
to think about. It is worth
remembering that many dance
forms that are classified as “folk”
also share several of the
characteristics considered typical
of “classical” forms. So, while the
use of the term “classical” may
suggest that these forms are
superior, this need not always be
literally true.
Other dance forms that are
recognised as classical at present are:
Bharatanatyam (Tamil Nadu)
Kathakali (Kerala)
Odissi (Orissa)
Kuchipudi (Andhra Pradesh)
Manipuri (Manipur)

2017-18Painting for Patrons: The Tradition
of Miniatures
Another tradition that developed in different ways was
that of miniature painting. Miniatures (as their very
name suggests) are small-sized paintings, generally
done in water colour on cloth or paper. The earliest
miniatures were on palm leaves or wood. Some of the
most beautiful of these, found in western India, were
used to illustrate Jaina texts. The Mughal emperors
Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised highly
skilled painters who primarily illustrated manuscripts
containing historical accounts and poetry. These were
generally painted in brilliant colours and portrayed
court scenes, scenes of battle or
hunting, and other aspects of social
life. They were often exchanged as
gifts and were viewed only by an
exclusive few – the emperor and his
close associates.

With the decline of the Mughal
Empire, many painters moved out
to the courts of the emerging regional
states (see also Chapter 10). As a
result Mughal artistic tastes
influenced the regional courts of the
Deccan and the Rajput courts of
Rajasthan. At the same time, they
retained and developed their
distinctive characteristics. Portraits
of rulers and court scenes came to
be painted, following the Mughal
example. Besides, themes from
mythology and poetry were depicted
at centres such as Mewar, Jodhpur,
Bundi, Kota and Kishangarh.
Another region that attracted
miniature paintings was the
Himalayan foothills around the

Pradesh. By the late seventeenth century this region
had developed a bold and intense style of miniature
painting called Basohli. The most popular text to be
painted here was Bhanudatta’s Rasamanjari. Nadir
Shah’s invasion and the conquest of Delhi in 1739
resulted in the migration of Mughal artists to the
hills to escape the uncertainties of the plains. Here

2017-18they found ready patrons which led to the founding
of the Kangra school of painting. By the mid-
eighteenth century the Kangra artists developed a
style which breathed a new spirit into miniature
painting. The sour ce of inspiration was the
Vaishnavite traditions. Soft colours including cool
blues and greens, and a lyrical treatment of themes
distinguished Kangra painting.
Remember that ordinary women and men painted
as well – on pots, walls, floors, cloth – works of art that
have occasionally survived, unlike the miniatures
that were carefully preserved in palaces for centuries.

The Growth of a Regional Language

OUR PASTS

As we saw at the outset, we often tend to identify
regions in terms of the language spoken by the
people. So, we assume that people in Bengal always
spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that
while Bengali is now recognised as a language
derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first
millennium BCE ) suggest that the people of Bengal
did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did
the new language emerge?
From the fourth-third centuries BCE , commercial
ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha
(south Bihar), which may have led to the growing
130
2017-18influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the
Gupta rulers established political control over north
Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area.
Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the
mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh
century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed
that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all
over Bengal.
From the eighth century, Bengal became the
centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas
(Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth
centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were
independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In
1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the
nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the
language of administration, Bengali developed as a
regional language.
In fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group
of dialects came to be united by a common literary
language based on the spoken language of the
western part of the region, now known as West
Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from
Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of
evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words,
derived from a variety of sources including tribal
languages, Persian, and European languages, have
become part of modern Bengali.
Early Bengali literature may be divided into two
categories – one indebted to Sanskrit and the other
independent of it. The first includes translations of
the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally
auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and
bhakti literature such as the biographies of
Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti
movement (Chapter 8).
The second includes Nath literature such as the
songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories
concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy
tales, folk tales and ballads.
131

2017-18Maynamati, Gopichandra and

The Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of
yogic practices.
This particular song, which was often enacted,
described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her
son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in
the face of a variety of obstacles.
Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often
worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood.
?
The texts belonging to the first category are easier
to date, as several manuscripts have been found
indicating that they were composed between the late
fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those
belonging to the second category circulated orally and
cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly
popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of
Brahmanas was relatively weak.

Pirs and Temples
From the sixteenth century, people began to migrate
in large numbers from the less fertile western Bengal
to the forested and marshy areas of south-eastern
Bengal. As they moved eastwards, they cleared forests
and brought the land under rice cultivation.
Gradually, local communities of fisherfolk and shifting
cultivators, often tribals, merged with the new
communities of peasants.
This coincided with the establishment of Mughal
control over Bengal with their capital in the heart of
the eastern delta at Dhaka. Officials and functionaries
received land and often set up mosques that served as
centres for religious transformation in these areas.
The early settlers sought some order and assurance
in the unstable conditions of the new settlements.

2017-18These were provided by community leaders, who also
functioned as teachers and adjudicators and were
sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers. People
referred to them with affection and respect as pirs.
This term included saints or Sufis and other
religious personalities, daring colonisers and deified
soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even
animistic spirits. The cult of pirs became very popular
and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal.
Bengal also witnessed a temple-building spree from
the late fifteenth century, which culminated in the
nineteenth century. We have seen (Chapters 2 and 5)
that temples and other religious structures were often
built by individuals or groups who were becoming
powerful – to both demonstrate their power and
proclaim their piety. Many of the modest brick and
terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the
support of several “low” social groups, such as the
Kolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal
workers). The coming of the European trading
companies created new economic opportunities; many
families belonging to these social groups availed of
these. As their social and economic position improved,

they proclaimed their status through the construction
of temples. When local deities, once worshipped in
thatched huts in villages, gained the recognition of
the Brahmanas, their images began to be housed in
temples. The temples began to copy the double-roofed
(dochala) or four-roofed (chauchala) structure of the
thatched huts. (Remember the “Bangla dome” in
Chapter 5?) This led to the evolution of the typical
Bengali style in temple architecture.
In the comparatively more complex four-roofed
structure, four triangular roofs placed on the four walls
move up to converge on a curved line or a point.
Temples were usually built on a square platform. The
interior was relatively plain, but the outer walls of many
temples were decorated with paintings, ornamental
tiles or terracotta tablets. In some temples, particularly
in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of West Bengal,
such decorations reached a high degree of excellence.

2017-18Fish as Food
Traditional food habits are generally based
on locally available items of food. Bengal is
a riverine plain which produces plenty of
rice and fish. Understandably, these two
items figure prominently in the menu of
even poor Bengalis. Fishing has always
been an important occupation and Bengali
literature contains several references to
fish. What is more, terracotta plaques on
the walls of temples and viharas (Buddhist
monasteries) depict scenes of fish being
dressed and taken to the market in baskets.
Brahmanas were not allowed to eat non-
vegetarian food, but the popularity of fish
in the local diet made the Brahmanical
authorities relax this prohibition for the
Bengal Brahmanas. The Brihaddharma
Purana, a thirteenth-century Sanskrit text
from Bengal, permitted the local Brahmanas to eat
certain varieties of fish.

Emergence of nation-states in Europe
Till the eighteenth century, people in Europe saw themselves as
subjects of an empire, such as the Austro-Hungarian empire, or
members of a church, such as the Greek Orthodox church. But,
from the late eighteenth century, people also began to identify
themselves as members of a community that spoke a common
language, such as French or German. By the early nineteenth
century, in Rumania school textbooks began to be written in
Rumanian rather than in Greek, and in Hungary Hugarian was
adopted as the official language instead of Latin. These and other
similar developments created the consciousness among the people
that each linguistic community was a separate nation. This feeling
was strengthened by the movements for Italian and German
unification in the late nineteenth century.

The Crisis of the Empire and
the Later Mughals
In Chapter 4 you saw how the Mughal Empire reached
the height of its success and started facing a variety of
crises towards the closing years of the seventeenth
century. These were caused by a number of factors.
Emperor Aurangzeb had depleted the military and
financial resources of his empire by fighting a long
war in the Deccan.
Under his successors, the efficiency of the imperial
administration broke down. It became increasingly
difficult for the later Mughal emperors to keep a check
on their powerful mansabdars. Nobles appointed as

EIGHTEENTH - CENTURY
POLITICAL FORMATIONSgovernors (subadars) often controlled the offices of
revenue and military administration (diwani and
faujdari) as well. This gave them extraordinary
political, economic and military powers over vast
regions of the Mughal Empire. As the governors
consolidated their control over the provinces, the
periodic remission of revenue to the capital declined.
Peasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of
northern and western India added to these problems.
These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures
of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts
by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own
positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by
rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups
were now able to seize the economic resources of the
region to consolidate their positions. The Mughal
emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the
gradual shifting of political and economic authority
into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains
and other groups.
Rich harvests and empty coffers
The following is a contemporary writer’s account of
the financial bankruptcy of the empire:
The great lords are helpless and impoverished. Their peasants
raise two crops a year, but their lords see nothing of either,
and their agents on the spot are virtual prisoners in the
peasants’ hands, like a peasant kept in his creditor’s house
until he can pay his debt. So complete is the collapse of all
order and administration that though the peasant reaps a
harvest of gold, his lord does not see so much as a wisp of
straw. How then can the lord keep the armed force he should?
How can he pay the soldiers who should go before him when
he goes out, or the horsemen who should ride behind him?

140In the midst of this economic and political crisis,
the ruler of Iran, Nadir Shah, sacked and plundered
the city of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense
amounts of wealth. This invasion was followed by a
series of plundering raids by the Afghan ruler Ahmad
Shah Abdali, who invaded north India five times
between 1748 and 1761.
Nadir Shah attacks Delhi
The devastation of Delhi after Nadir Shah’s invasion was
described by contemporary observers. One described
the wealth looted from the Mughal treasury as follows:
sixty lakhs of rupees and some thousand gold coins, nearly
one crore worth of gold-ware, nearly fifty crores worth of
jewels, most of them unrivalled in the world, and the above
included the Peacock throne.
Another account described the invasion’s impact
upon Delhi:
(those) ... who had been masters were now in dire straits;
and those who had been revered couldn’t even (get water to)
quench their thirst. The recluses were pulled out of their
corners. The wealthy were turned into beggars. Those who
once set the style in clothes now went naked; and those who
owned property were now homeless ... The New City
(Shahjahanabad) was turned into rubble. (Nadir Shah) then
attacked the Old quarters of the city and destroyed a whole
world that existed there ...

Shah.
Already under severe pressure from all sides, the
empire was further weakened by competition amongst
different groups of nobles. They were divided into two
major groups or factions, the Iranis and Turanis (nobles
of Turkish descent). For a long time, the later Mughal
emperors were puppets in the hands of either one or
the other of these two powerful groups. The worst

emperors, Farrukh Siyar (1713-1719) and
Alamgir II (1754-1759) were assassinated, and
two others Ahmad Shah (1748-1754) and
Shah Alam II (1759-1816) were blinded by
their nobles.
Emergence of New States
With the decline in the authority of the Mughal
emperors, the governors of large provinces,
subadars, and the great zamindars
consolidated their authority in different parts
of the subcontinent. Through the eighteenth
century, the Mughal Empire gradually
fragmented into a number of independent,
regional states. Broadly speaking the states
of the eighteenth century can be divided into three
overlapping groups: (1) States that were old Mughal
provinces like Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad.
Although extremely powerful and quite independent,
the rulers of these states did not break their formal
ties with the Mughal emperor. (2) States that had
enjoyed considerable independence under the Mughals
as watan jagirs. These included several Rajput
principalities. (3) The last group included states under
the control of Marathas, Sikhs and others like the Jats.
These were of differing sizes and had seized their
independence from the Mughals after a long-drawn
armed struggle.

The Old Mughal Provinces
Amongst the states that were carved out of the old
Mughal provinces in the eighteenth century, three
stand out very prominently. These were Awadh, Bengal
and Hyderabad. All three states were founded by
members of the high Mughal nobility who had been
governors of large provinces – Sa‘adat Khan (Awadh),
Murshid Quli Khan (Bengal) and Asaf Jah (Hyderabad).
All three had occupied high mansabdari positions and
enjoyed the trust and confidence of the emperors. Both

Hyderabad
Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of Hyderabad state
(1724-1748), was one of the most powerful members at
the court of the Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar. He was
entrusted first with the governorship of Awadh, and later
given charge of the Deccan. As the Mughal governor of
the Deccan provinces, during 1720-22 Asaf Jah had
already gained control over its political and financial
administration. Taking subsequent advantage of the
turmoil in the Deccan and the competition amongst the
court nobility, he gathered power in his hands and became
the actual ruler of that region.
Asaf Jah brought skilled soldiers and administrators
from northern India who welcomed the new opportunities
in the south. He appointed mansabdars and granted
jagirs. Although he was still a servant of the Mughal
emperor, he ruled quite independently without seeking
any direction from Delhi or facing any interference. The
Mughal emperor merely confirmed the decisions already
taken by the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah.
The state of Hyderabad was constantly engaged in a
struggle against the Marathas to the west and with
independent Telugu warrior chiefs (nayakas) of the plateau.
The ambitions of the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah to control
the rich textile-producing areas of the Coromandel coast
in the east were checked by the British who were becoming
increasingly powerful in that region (see Map 2).
The Nizam’s army

troopers in 1790:

Burhan-ul-Mulk Sa‘adat Khan
was appointed subadar of
Awadh in 1722 and founded
a state which was one of the
most important to emerge
out of the break-up of the
Mughal Empire. Awadh was a
prosperous region, controlling
the rich alluvial Ganga plain
and the main trade route
between north India and
Bengal. Burhan-ul-Mulk also
held the combined offices of
subadari, diwani and faujdari.
In other words, he was
responsible for managing the
political, financial and military
affairs of the province of Awadh.

Fig. 3

Burhan-ul-Mulk tried to
decrease Mughal influence in the Awadh region by
reducing the number of office holders (jagirdars)
appointed by the Mughals. He also reduced the size
of jagirs, and appointed his own loyal servants to
vacant positions. The accounts of jagirdars were
checked to prevent cheating and the revenues of all
districts were reassessed by officials appointed by the
Nawab’s court. He seized a number of Rajput
zamindaris and the agriculturally fertile lands of the
Afghans of Rohilkhand.
The state depended on local bankers and mahajans
for loans. It sold the right to collect tax to the highest
bidders. These “revenue farmers” (ijaradars) agreed to
pay the state a fixed sum of money. Local bankers
guaranteed the payment of this contracted amount to
the state. In turn, the revenue-farmers were given
considerable freedom in the assessment and collection
of taxes. These developments allowed new social
groups, like moneylenders and bankers, to influence

144the management of the state’s revenue system,
something which had not occurred in the past.
Bengal
Bengal gradually broke away from Mughal control under
Murshid Quli Khan who was appointed as the naib,
deputy to the governor of the province. Although never
a formal subadar, Murshid Quli Khan very quickly
seized all the power that went with that office. Like the
rulers of Hyderabad and Awadh he also commanded
the revenue administration of the state. In an effort to
reduce Mughal influence in Bengal he transferred all
Mughal jagirdars to Orissa and ordered a major
reassessment of the revenues of Bengal. Revenue was
collected in cash with great strictness from all
zamindars. As a result, many zamindars had to borrow
money from bankers and moneylenders. Those unable
to pay were forced to sell their lands to larger zamindars.
The formation of a regional state in eighteenth-
century Bengal therefore led to considerable change
amongst the zamindars. The close connection
between the state and bankers – noticeable in
Hyderabad and Awadh as well – was evident in

POLITICAL FORMATIONSBengal under the rule of Alivardi Khan (r. 1740-1756).
During his reign the banking house of Jagat Seth
became extremely prosperous.
If we take a bird’s eye view, we can detect three
common features amongst these states. First, though
many of the larger states were established by erstwhile
Mughal nobles they were highly suspicious of some of
the administrative systems that they had inherited, in
particular the jagirdari system. Second, their method
of tax collection differed. Rather than relying upon the
officers of the state, all three regimes contracted with
revenue-farmers for the collection of revenue. The
practice of ijaradari, thoroughly disapproved of by
the Mughals, spread all over India in the eighteenth
century. Their impact on the countryside differed
considerably. The third common feature in all these
regional states was their emerging relationship with
rich bankers and merchants. These people lent money
to revenue farmers, received land as security and
collected taxes from these lands through their own
agents. Throughout India the richest merchants and
bankers were gaining a stake in the new political order.
The Watan Jagirs of the Rajputs
Many Rajput kings, particularly those belonging to
Amber and Jodhpur, had served under the Mughals
with distinction. In exchange, they were permitted to
enjoy considerable autonomy in their watan jagirs. In
the eighteenth century, these rulers now attempted to
extend their control over adjacent regions. Ajit Singh,
the ruler of Jodhpur, was also involved in the factional
politics at the Mughal court.
These influential Rajput families claimed the
subadari of the rich provinces of Gujarat and Malwa.
Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur held the governorship of
Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was
governor of Malwa. These offices were renewed by
Emperor Jahandar Shah in 1713. They also tried to

campaigns into Rajasthan from the 1740s put severe
pressure on these principalities and checked their
further expansion.
Raja Jai Singh of Jaipur
A description of Raja Jai Singh in a Persian account of
1732:
Raja Jai Singh was at the height of his power. He was the
governor of Agra for 12 years and of Malwa for 5 or 6 years.
He possessed a large army, artillery and great wealth. His
sway extended from Delhi to the banks of the Narmada.

What is the Khalsa?
Do you recall
reading about
it in Chapter 8?
The organisation of the Sikhs into a political community
during the seventeenth century (see Chapter 8) helped
in regional state-building in the Punjab. Several battles
were fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput
and Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution
of the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the
Khalsa rose in revolt against the Mughal authority
under Banda Bahadur’s leadership, declared their
sovereign rule by striking coins in the name of Guru
Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh, and established their
own administration between the Sutlej and the
Jamuna. Banda Bahadur was captured in 1715 and
executed in 1716.

148Under a number of able leaders in the eighteenth
century, the Sikhs organized themselves into a number
of bands called jathas, and later on misls. Their
combined forces were known as the grand army (dal
khalsa). The entire body used to meet at Amritsar at
the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to take collective
decisions known as “resolutions of the Guru
(gurmatas)”. A system called rakhi was introduced,
offering protection to cultivators on the payment of a
tax of 20 per cent of the produce.
Guru Gobind Singh had inspired the Khalsa with
the belief that their destiny was to rule (raj karega
khalsa). Their well-knit organization enabled them to
put up a successful resistance to the Mughal governors
first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who had seized
the rich province of the Punjab and the Sarkar of
Sirhind from the Mughals. The Khalsa declared their
sovereign rule by striking their own coin again in 1765.
Significantly, this coin bore the same inscription as
the one on the orders issued by the Khalsa in the time
of Banda Bahadur.
The Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century
extended from the Indus to the Jamuna but they were
divided under different rulers. One of them, Maharaja
Ranjit Singh, reunited these groups and established
his capital at Lahore in 1799.

The Marathas
The Maratha kingdom was another powerful regional
kingdom to arise out of a sustained opposition to
Mughal rule. Shivaji (1627-1680) carved out a stable
kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families
(deshmukhs). Groups of highly mobile, peasant-
pastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the
Maratha army. Shivaji used these forces to challenge
the Mughals in the peninsula. After Shivaji’s death,
effective power in the Maratha state was wielded by a
family of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivaji’s
successors as Peshwa (or principal minister). Poona
became the capital of the Maratha kingdom.
149
EIGHTEENTH - CENTURY
POLITICAL FORMATIONSUnder the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very
successful military organisation. Their success lay
in bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by
raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas
where their supply lines and reinforcements could
be easily disturbed.
Between 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire
expanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority
of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized
from the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the
Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the
entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to
levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region.
Chauth
25 per cent of the
land revenue
claimed by
zamindars. In the
Deccan this was
collected by the
Marathas.
After raiding Delhi in 1737 the frontiers of Maratha
domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the
Punjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the
east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu
countries in the south (see Map 1). These were not
formally included in the Maratha empire, but were
made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha
sovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources,
but it came at a price. These military campaigns also
made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a
result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas
during the third battle of Panipat in 1761.
Sardeshmukhi
9-10 per cent of
the land revenue
paid to the head
revenue collector
in the Deccan.
Alongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas
developed an effective administrative system as well.
Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule
was secure, revenue demands were gradually
introduced taking local conditions into account.
Agriculture was encouraged and trade revived. This
allowed Maratha chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of
Gwalior, Gaekwad of Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur
the resources to raise powerful armies. Maratha
campaigns into Malwa in the 1720s did not challenge
the growth and prosperity of the cities in the region.
Ujjain expanded under Sindhia’s patronage and Indore
under Holkar’s. By all accounts these cities were large
and prosperous and functioned as important

150commercial and cultural centres. New trade routes
emerged within the areas controlled by the Marathas.
The silk produced in the Chanderi region now found a
new outlet in Poona, the Maratha capital. Burhanpur
which had earlier participated in the trade between
Agra and Surat now expanded its hinterland to include
Poona and Nagpur in the south and Lucknow and
Allahabad in the east.
The Jats
Like the other states the Jats consolidated their power
during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries.
Under their leader, Churaman, they acquired control
over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi,
and by the 1680s they had begun dominating the
region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and
Agra. For a while they became the virtual custodians
of the city of Agra.
The Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns
like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important
trading centres in the areas dominated by them. Under
Suraj Mal the kingdom of Bharatpur emerged as a
strong state. When Nadir Shah sacked Delhi in 1739,
many of the city’s notables took refuge there. His son
Jawahir Shah had 30,000 troops of his own and hired

POLITICAL FORMATIONSanother 20,000 Maratha and 15,000 Sikh troops to
fight the Mughals.
While the Bharatpur fort was built in a fairly traditional
style, at Dig the Jats built an elaborate garden palace
combining styles seen at Amber and Agra. Its buildings
were modelled on architectural forms first associated
with royalty under Shah Jahan (see Figure 12 in Chapter
5 and Figure 12 in Chapter 9).
The French Revolution (1789-1794)
In the various state systems of eighteenth-century India, the common
people did not enjoy the right to participate in the affairs of their
governments. In the Western world, this was the situation until the
late eighteenth century. The American (1776-1781) and French
Revolutions challenged the social and political privileges enjoyed
by the aristocrats.
During the French Revolution, the middle classes, peasants and
artisans fought against the special rights enjoyed by the clergy and
the nobility. They believed that no group in society should have
privileges based on birth. Rather, people’s social position must
depend on merit. The philosophers of the French Revolution
suggested that there be equal laws and opportunities for all. They
also held that the authority of the government should come from
the people who must possess the right to participate in its affairs.
Movements such as the French and American Revolutions gradually
transformed subjects into citizens.
The ideas of citizenship, nation-state and democratic rights took
root in India from the late nineteenth century.
