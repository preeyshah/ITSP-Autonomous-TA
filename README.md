# ITSP-Autonomous-TA

This is the github repo for the team The TA's including Sahil Shah, Shourya Pandey, Preey Shah and Aman Bansal

We aim to create an autonomous grader to serve the purpose of a teaching assistant.
It should be able to generate questions from a textbook and also generate the answers to a question given by the user and compare
it with a student's answer, thereby checking it.

We are implementing it using python
